         <h2>1. Background: The transformation of the OAU into the AU</h2>
         <h3>1.1 The OAU</h3>
         <p>The Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union, was established by the then independent states of Africa on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[[1]] The OAU Charter served as a roadmap for the efforts and actions of the independent African States to liberate the Continent from colonialism and apartheid. By the end of the 1970s, much of Africa was liberated from colonialism with the exception of the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe. This new reality in Africa led to the call for the review of the OAU Charter as early as 1979. The sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held in Monrovia, Liberia, in July 1979 established the OAU Charter Review Committee (the Committee) in a bid ‘to re-examine the provisions of the Charter in light of the changes and realities in Africa’. [[2]] The Committee was meant to make a detailed study of the OAU Charter in light of the current needs of the Continent and come up with specific proposals for new norms and institutions that would have been instrumental in responding to the atrocities like the Rwandan genocide.</p>
         <p>The Committee attempted to forward a proposal for new rules and institutions that would make the Charter more effective. [[3]] Nevertheless, the activities of the Committee were very slow and highly marginalised because of the absence of active involvement of member States. New developments on the Continent and worldwide, such as the total liberation of African States from colonialism, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the challenges of massive human rights violations inside independent African States and intra-state and inter-state conflicts and the end of the cold war made the transformation of the OAU a necessity.</p>
         <h3>1.2 The Sirte Declaration and the establishment of the African Union</h3>
         <p>By July 1999, when the OAU Thirty-fifth Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Algiers, it was clear that the OAU Charter Review Committee had failed to achieve its purpose. The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government accepted a call for an extraordinary meeting on the issue of the transformation of the OAU [[4]] and decided to hold its 4th extraordinary meeting ‘to discuss ways and means of making the OAU effective so as to keep pace with political and economic developments taking place in the world and the preparation required of Africa within the context of globalization so as to preserve its socio-economic and political potentials’.[[5]] Accordingly, the fourth extraordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Sirte, Libya on 8-9 September 1999 and adopted the Sirte Declaration, which inter alia called for the establishment of the African Union:</p>
         <p>Article 8 ‘Having discussed frankly and extensively on how to proceed with the strengthening of the unity of our continent and its peoples, in the light of those proposals, and bearing in mind the current situation on the Continent, we decide to: (i) Establish an African Union, in conformity with the ultimate objectives of the Charter of our Continental Organization and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.’ [[6]]</p>
         <p>The Sirte Declaration did not specify the details of the new organisation. Rather the Declaration instructed the Council of Ministers and the Secretary-General of the OAU to work on the details of the establishment of the new organisation (African Union) and report their work to the next ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.[[7]] Accordingly, the OAU Secretary-General established a Departmental Task Force under the Chairmanship of the OAU Assistant-Secretary General for Political Affairs to design the steps that should be taken by the OAU Secretariat to implement the Sirte Declaration.[[8]] The Departmental Task force recommended involvement of expert consultants to develop the preparatory documents for the Constitutive Act of the African Union in collaboration with the OAU Secretariat.[[9]]</p>
         <p>In February 2000, a group of consultants with backgrounds in law, economics and politics met in Addis Ababa and came up with a draft Constitutive Act of the African Union.[[10]] After consultation by the OAU Secretariat with member states, the draft Constitutive Act together with earlier draft proposals from member states were presented to two consecutive meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians on the establishment of the African Union that were held on 17-20 April 2000 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and 27-29 May 2000 in Tripoli, Libya respectively.[[11]] The meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and presented their assessment to a Ministerial Conference on the Establishment of the African Union on 31 May - 2 June 2000 in Tripoli, Libya. The Ministerial Conference reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and decided to establish a working group to further elaborate on the draft Constitutive Act.[[12]] The working group submitted the revised draft Constitutive Act to the Seventy-second ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers on 6-8 July 2000 in Lome, Togo.[[13]]</p>
         <p>After further deliberations, the OAU Council of Ministers approved the draft Constitutive Act and recommended its submission to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government for adoption.[[14]] The thirty-sixth ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of the Heads of State and Government held in Lome, Togo on 10-12 July 2000 adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union and urged member states of the OAU to ratify the Constitutive Act as soon as possible.[[15]] The fifth extraordinary meeting of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government declared the political birth of the African Union and noted that the Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) would enter in to force 30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification by two-thirds of the member States of the OAU, as provided for in Article 28 of the Constitutive Act.[[16]] The Constitutive Act entered into force on 26 May 2001 up on ratification by two thirds of member States of the OAU replacing the OAU Charter.[[17]] The African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held its inaugural session in Durban, South Africa, on 9 July 2002.[[18]]</p>
         <h2>2. Membership of the African Union</h2>
         <p>There are only two requirements for membership in the African Union (AU). First, a State should be an African State to be a member of the AU. [[19]] Second, an African State should sign and ratify the AU Constitutive Act. [[20]] All African States except Morocco have ratified the AU Constitutive Act and are therefore members of the AU. [[21]]</p>
         <p>An African State (Morocco, as the only non-member), can accede to the AU Constitutive Act and become a member of the AU if and when the AU member States support the application for accession and admission by a simple majority.[[22]] There are no criteria set in the Constitutive Act as standards for the vote on the request for accession. Moreover, all AU member States have the same rights and obligations. The Constitutive Act does not provide for a veto power or any kind of special status for any member State of the AU.</p>
         <p>Withdrawal of membership is allowed after a member State notifies in writing its intention to renounce its membership of the Union to the Chairperson of the AU Commission, who will communicate such notification to the other State parties of the Constitutive Act.[[23]] The applicant should wait one year from the date of notification of its intention to renounce membership before its rights and obligations under the Constitutive Act are terminated.[[24]] The rights and obligations of the member State remain intact during the one year window period.[[25]] After a window period of one year, the applicant is deemed to have withdrawn its membership if it does not rescind its decision to renounce its membership. Article 12 of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act provides for the repeal of the right to renounce membership. [[26]] The explanatory notes accompanying the proposal for the removal of the right recognizes that renunciation of membership is the right of member States but nevertheless argues for the deletion of the right as it has a negative connotation on the unity of the region.[[27]]</p>
         <h2>3. The Objectives and Principles of the African Union</h2>
         <p>Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitutive Act of the AU enumerate the objectives and principles of the regional organization. The objectives and principles can be summarized into the following six interrelated areas. The first three sub-sections focus on the objectives while the rest three focus on explaining the principles that are meant to be used to achieve the objectives.</p>
         <h3>3.1 Regional Integration</h3>
         <p>The AU is planned to be a forum for the promotion of regional integration and African unity through socio-economic integration, continental research on all fields including science and technology and the development of common positions on issues of common interest. [[28]] The AU also establishes institutions that nurture solidarity among African peoples, coordinate its actions with sub-regional economic communities and forges a common front in international negotiations and cooperation. [[29]]</p>
         <h3>3.2 Peace and Security</h3>
         <p>The AU member States recognize that ‘the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent’.[[30]] Thus, one important objective area of the AU is the establishment of collective security system in a bid to promote peace and security as a prerequisite for development on the continent.[[31]] The focus on peace and security can also be gathered from the new norms and institutions of collective security that member States established.[[32]] AU member States pledge to strengthen and provide necessary mandate and resources to all relevant institutions including institutions for the maintenance of collective security.[[33]]</p>
         <h3>3.3 Protection of Human Rights</h3>
         <p>The protection of human rights is provided as one major objective for the establishment of the AU. One reason given by member States for establishing the AU is their determination ‘to promote and protect human and peoples’ rights, consolidate democratic institutions and culture, and to ensure good governance and the rule of law.’[[34]] Thus, the AU member States set the observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one objective of the organization. [[35]] Moreover, the promotion of ‘democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance’ is provided as an objective of the organization within the promotion and protection of the rights of African people. [[36]]</p>
         <h3>3.4 Non-Intervention</h3>
         <p>The AU Constitutive Act rules out unilateral intervention between member States. Unilateral intervention among member States is pointed out as a common security threat on the Continent. [[37]] Apart from the direct principle of ‘non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another’, [[38]] the non-intervention norm is expressed through many principles of the organisation. For instance, the Constitutive Act rejects subversive activities in member States.[[39]] Subversion is defined as constituting ‘any act that incites, aggravates or creates dissension within or among Member States with the intention or purpose to destabilize or overthrow the existing regime or political order by, among other means, fomenting racial, religious, linguistic, ethnic and other differences’ in violation of the Constitutive Act and the Charter of the United Nations.[[40]] Thus, subversion does not only include the use or threat of military force, which is prohibited under the Constitutive Act,[[41]] but also the non-military means of interference.[[42]] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the AU proposes two additional principles on subversion that request ‘restraint by any Member State from entering into any treaty or alliance that is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the Union’ and prohibit ‘any Member State from allowing the use of its territory as a base for subversion against another Member State.’[[43]]</p>
         <p>The AU non-intervention principle is based on the principles of sovereign equality and interdependence among member States and respect of borders existing on achievement of independence. [[44]] The principles of ‘peaceful co-existence of Member States and their right to live in peace and security’ and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among member States are also the basis of the non-intervention norm among member States of the AU. [[45]]</p>
         <h3>3.5 Intervention</h3>
         <p>Intervention in member States under the AU constitutes unprecedented principle under international law. The AU is endowed with the right to intervene ‘in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity’.[[46]] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union adds ‘a serious threat to legitimate order to restore peace and stability to the Member State of the Union’ as an additional element that would trigger intervention by the AU in a member State on top of crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.[[47]]</p>
         <p>AU member States have also agreed on the right to ‘request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and security’. [[48]] This is a case of intervention by invitation. The request for intervention from a member State is made to the Assembly of the AU, which is the highest decision-making organ. [[49]]</p>
         <h3>3.6 Respect for Democracy and Rule of Law</h3>
         <p>AU member States have acknowledged the relation between democracy, rule of law and economic development. The principles of respect for democracy, rule of law, and good governance are adopted as precondition for social justice that ensures economic development in member States of the AU.[[50]] The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (a.k.a NEPAD) is one framework launched by African States that links the respect for civil and political rights with the right to development in member States of the AU.[[51]] AU member States adopted the principle of ‘condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of governments’.[[52]] The rejection of impunity is also a principle adopted by the AU member States that strengthen their commitment to the rule of law.[[53]]</p>
         <h2>4. The Institutions of the African Union</h2>
         <p>Article 5 of the AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the following institutions of the Union: the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Specialized Technical Committees, the Pan-African Parliament, the Court of Justice, the Financial Institutions, the Commission, the Permanent Representatives Committee, and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council. [[54]] Another key institution, which was not directly established by the Constitutive Act, is the AU Peace and Security Council. A brief exposition based on the Constitutive Act and respective protocols of the institution follows.</p>
         <h3>4.1 The Assembly</h3>
         <p>The AU Assembly is the supreme decision-making organ of the Union.[[55]] It is composed of the Heads of State and Government of all member States of the African Union or their accredited representatives.[[56]] The Assembly meets at least once in a year in an ordinary session and convenes for an extra ordinary meeting at the request of a member State and at the approval of two-third majority of member States.[[57]] In its 2004 summit the AU Assembly decided to meet twice a year in ordinary session citing its increasing responsibilities in the face of the many challenges of the Continent.[[58]] All the sessions of the Assembly are to be held at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[[59]] However, the Assembly can hold its session elsewhere if a member State extends invitation to host the session. The inviting State should not be under sanction from the AU and should be able to meet pre-determined criteria such as paying up all financial obligations to the Union and maintaining favorable political atmosphere.[[60]] The Assembly should hold at least one session at the headquarters of the Union every other year based on its calendar.[[61]] As a matter of rule all sessions of the Assembly are closed.[[62]] However, the Assembly may decide to hold open sessions with a vote of simple majority.[[63]] The decisions of the Assembly are made either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority of the member States of the Union.[[64]]</p>
         <p>The Assembly is lead by a Chairperson elected among the heads of State or government for a period of one year.[[65]] The Chairperson of the Assembly is generally elected after consultations among member States and based on the principle of rotation.[[66]] However, as an exception to the rule, the head of state or government of a host country which has invited the Assembly for its proceedings is given the automatic right to be the Chairperson of the Assembly.[[67]] The Chairperson of the Assembly is assisted by the Bureau for each summit composed of fourteen Vice-Chairpersons elected based on geographical distribution and due consultations.[[68]] The Chairperson is responsible, inter alia, to convene the sessions of the Assembly, guide the proceedings of the Assembly, rule on point of order and in consultation with the Chairperson of the Commission represents the Union in between sessions.[[69]]</p>
         <p>As the supreme organ of the Union, the Assembly determines the policies of all organs of the Union.[[70]] It monitors the implementation of policies and decisions by its organs and takes decisions on reports and recommendations from its organs such as a recommendation for intervention in member States from the Peace and Security Council.[[71]] In particular the Assembly directs the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and the Commission on management of conflicts, acts of terrorism and emergency situations.[[72]] The Assembly is mandated to impose sanctions on member States for violation of the principles enshrined in the Constitutive Act.[[73]] Moreover, the Assembly adopts the budget of the Union and appoints and removes the judges to both the African Human Rights Court and the Court of Justice of the Union.[[74]]</p>
         <p>The structure, functions and regulations of the AU Commission,[[75]] the administrative wing of the organization, is determined by the Assembly.[[76]] The Assembly appoints the Chairperson of the Commission and his/her deputies as well as all other Commissioners of the Union and determines their functions and terms of office.[[77]] The Assembly is also given power of interpretation of the Constitutive Act until the establishment of the AU Court of Justice.[[78]] The Assembly has the right to delegate its powers and functions to any organ of the AU.[[79]]</p>
         <h3>4.2 The Executive Council</h3>
         <p>The Executive Council is another decision-making organ composed of the ministers of foreign affairs or equivalent authorities designated by the governments of the member States of the AU.[[80]] The Executive Council is directly accountable to the Assembly.[[81]] The details of most decisions and policies of the Assembly of the Union are worked out by the Council before they are presented to the Assembly for final decision.[[82]] The Executive Council has the power to make its own binding decisions on common interest of member States such as foreign trade, energy, transport and communication, education, culture, health, and immigration.[[83]] The Executive Council can also make binding decisions in other areas based on the delegation given to it from the Assembly.[[84]] The Executive Council meets at least twice a year in ordinary sessions while extraordinary meetings can be held when a member state requires and two-thirds of the member States support the request.[[85]] In practice, the Executive Council holds its meetings immediately before every session of the AU Assembly. The meeting of the Executive Council is chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or equivalent authority whose country holds the Chair of the Assembly or in case of extraordinary session the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the host member State.[[86]] As a rule all sessions of the Executive Council are closed unless the Council decides by simple majority to hold open meeting.[[87]] The Executive Council makes its decisions by consensus or, failing which, by a two-thirds majority of the member States.[[88]] The Executive Council is assisted by the Permanent Representative Committee[[89]] and the seven Specialized Technical Committees of the AU.</p>
         <h3>4.3 The Specialized Technical Committees</h3>
         <p>The Specialized Technical Committees are various committees responsible for, inter alia, the preparation and coordination of the projects and programs of the Union and supervision and follow-up of the policies of the Union or any function assigned by the Executive Council.[[90]] The Specialized Committees are accountable to the Executive Council.[[91]] The Committees are composed of ministers or senior officials of member States responsible for rural economy and agriculture; monetary and financial affairs; trade, customs and immigration matters; industry, science and technology, energy, natural resources and environment; transport, communications and tourism; Health, Labor and Social Affairs; and Education, Culture and Human Resources.[[92]] The Assembly has the mandate to add other relevant committees or reorganize the existing Specialized Committees as it deems fit.[[93]] The Specialized Technical Committees meet as often as required by their tasks or as directed by the Executive Council.[[94]]</p>
         <h3>4.4 The Permanent Representatives Committee</h3>
         <p>The Permanent Representative Committee (PRC) is a body composed of permanent representatives of member States to the AU resident at the Headquarters of the Union in Addis Ababa or other duly accredited plenipotentiaries of member States.[[95]] The PRC is accountable to the Executive Council.[[96]] The PRC serves as an advisory body to Executive Council.[[97]] The PRC prepares the bulk of the work of the Executive Council, carrying out most of the practical activities for the Executive Council including the preparation and recommendation of agendas for the sessions of the Executive Council and drafting proposals for decisions of the Executive Council.[[98]] The PRC monitors the implementation of the budget of the Union and the decisions of the Executive Council.[[99]] The Executive Council can assign more functions to the PRC.[[100]] The PRC can establish ad-hoc committees and working groups to carry out its tasks.[[101]] The PRC is also the organ that facilitates the communication between the Commission of the AU and member States.[[102]] The PRC holds its sessions at the headquarters of the AU at least once in a month chaired by the Permanent Representative whose country holds the chair of the Executive Council.[[103]] All the sessions of the PRC are closed unless the PRC decides by simple majority to hold open meeting.[[104]]</p>
         <h3>4.5 The Peace and Security Council</h3>
         <h4>4.5.1. Establishment</h4>
         <p>The AU Constitutive Act does not establish the Peace and Security Council as one the organs of the AU.[[105]] In the initial process of establishing the AU, the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was incorporated and retained as a peace and security organ of the AU based on Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act.[[106]] Following the incorporation of the Central Organ, the OAU Assembly requested the OAU Secretary-General to undertake a review of the structures, procedures and working methods of the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism, including the possibility of changing its name.[[107]] The OAU Secretary-General presented his report and the draft protocol for the establishment of a new Peace and Security Council to the OAU Council of Ministers in July 2002 during the transition from OAU to the AU. [[108]] The draft protocol was presented to the first ordinary session of the Assembly of African Union held in Durban, South Africa. The Protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council was adopted by the first ordinary session of the AU Assembly and entered into force on 26 December 2003.[[109]]</p>
         <p>The Peace and Security Council is a permanent decision-making organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa established on the basis of Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act of the AU.[[110]] The Peace and Security Council is situated at the Headquarters of the African Union.[[111]] </p>
         <h4>4.5.2 Composition</h4>
         <p>The member States of the Peace and Security Council are fifteen in number, elected by the AU Assembly based on the principles of equitable regional representation and rotation, with three members from the centre, three members from the east, two members from the north, three members from the south and four members from the west of Africa.[[112]] There is no provision for permanent and non-permanent members of the Peace and Security Council.[[113]] However, the Peace and Security Council Protocol has provided detailed criteria for membership of States to the Council. The Peace and Security Council Protocol requires that prospective member States to the Peace and Security Council should exhibit, inter alia, respect for constitutional governance, the rule of law, the protection of human rights and the commitment to honor financial obligations of the Union.[[114]] Any AU member State that meets the criteria may apply for membership to the Peace and Security Council.[[115]] Initial election on the candidacy is preferably done by each sub-region of Africa which would later submit the candidates to the AU Assembly, the organ which makes the final selection.[[116]] The first members of the Peace and Security Council were elected by the Executive Council as delegated by the Assembly.[[117]]</p>
         <p>The Peace and Security Council Protocol also provides that the Assembly shall conduct a periodic review to assess the extent to which elected members of the Council continue to meet the membership criteria and ‘take action as appropriate’.[[118]] The phrase ‘take action as appropriate’ refers to the possibility of dismissal of a member State from the Peace and Security Council when it fails to fulfill the criteria of membership specified under Article 5(2) of the Peace and Security Council Protocol.</p>
         <h4>4.5.3 Supporting Institutions</h4>
         <p>In implementing its mandate, the Peace and Security Council works with the various AU organs including the Assembly, Pan-African Parliament and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[[119]] The following organs are designated as supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council: the AU Commission, the Peace Fund, the Continental Early Warning System, the Panel of the Wise, the African Standby Force and the Military Staff Committee.[[120]] A brief overview of each supporting institution follows.</p>
         <p><b>(A) The AU Commission</b></p>
         <p>The Peace and Security directorate is the main organ of the AU Commission responsible for providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council.[[121]] The Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission provides the Council with a permanent Secretariat to run its day to day activities.[[122]] Moreover, the Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission establishes and operationalise all the supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council namely the Continental Early Warning System, the African Standby Force and the Peace Fund and the Panel of the Wise.[[123]] Moreover, the Chairperson of the AU Commission has the responsibility to monitor the implementation of decisions adopted by the Peace and Security Council upon the approval of the Assembly.[[124]]</p>
         <p><b>(B) The Peace Fund</b></p>
         <p>The Peace and Security Council Protocol provides for the establishment of a Special Fund, known as the Peace Fund, in order to finance the activities of the AU aimed at maintaining peace and security in the Continent.[[125]] The primary source of the Peace Fund is the regular budget to the African Union, known as the General Peace Fund.[[126]] The other major category of the Peace Fund is what is called the Special Contribution.[[127]] Under the Special Contribution, the sources of the Peace fund are voluntary contributions from AU member States, voluntary contributions from the private sector and civil society as well as individuals in AU member States and donations from non-member States.[[128]] Donations and voluntary contributions from sources outside of Africa are accepted in so far as they are ‘in conformity with the objectives and principles of the Union’. [[129]]</p>
         <p><b>(C) The Continental Early Warning System</b></p>
         <p>The Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) is a supporting institution designed to carry out the prevention and early warning mandate of the Peace and Security Council.[[130]] It consists of two important bodies: the main observation and monitoring center under the Peace and Security directorate located at the headquarters of the AU (called ‘The Situation Room’) and a communication panel with the observation and monitoring rooms in each of the sub-regional organizations.[[131]] The Situation Room collects and analyses information from ‘the public domain in hard and soft prints, including newspapers both private and public, satellite TV channels, electronic news sites, and from informal sources on the ground.’[[132]] The information is then processed and compiled in the form of ‘News Briefs’, and is forwarded to the relevant organs of the AU three times a day and should be posted and circulated through the intranet for all staff of the organization.[[133]]</p>
         <p>The Situation Room is planed to be linked to similar information centers of the sub-regional organizations in the continent.[[134]] The Situation Room also benefits from its collaboration with the United Nations agencies and other international organizations, academic institutions and NGOs.[[135]] The observation and monitoring is based on an early warning module which contains political, economic, social, military and humanitarian indicators.[[136]] After series of consultations and meetings of experts, an operational framework for the CEWS has been approved by the AU Executive Council in the beginning of 2007.[[137]]</p>
         <p><b>(D) The Panel of the Wise</b></p>
         <p>The Panel of the Wise is an advisory body composed of five highly respected African personalities who have made outstanding contribution to the cause of peace and security on the Continent. Members of the Panel are appointed by the Assembly for a term of three years. The Panel of the Wise advises the Peace and Security Council and the AU Commission on conflict prevention and promotion of stability in Africa.</p>
         <p><b>(E) The African Standby Force</b></p>
         <p>A key enforcement and supporting institution under the Peace and Security Council is the African Standby Force. The Peace and Security Protocol provides for the establishment of the African Standby Force composed of civilian and military personnel for the purpose of implementing the peacekeeping and intervention mandate of the AU. [[138]]</p>
         <p><b>(F) The Military Staff Committee</b></p>
         <p>The Military Staff Committee (MSC) is a standing advisory body to the Peace and Security Council on military and related security matters. [[139]] The MSC is composed of Senior Military Officers of members of the Peace and Security Council.[[140]] However, the MSC can also meet at the level of Chiefs of Defence Staff of members of the Peace and Security Council.[[141]] The MSC members meet as often as required, and at least once in a month.[[142]] Even though the MSC is directly accountable to the Peace and Security Council, it can also consult with other relevant organs of the AU.[[143]] The meetings of the MSC follow the Rules of Procedure provided under the Policy Framework for the establishment of the ASF and MSC[[144]] and where applicable the rules of procedure of the Peace and Security Council. [[145]] </p>
         <h3>4.6 The Pan-African Parliament</h3>
         <p>The AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament (PAP) whose functions, composition and powers are provided under a separate protocol.[[146]] The Protocol for the establishment of the PAP provides that the PAP is composed Parliamentarians elected from the Parliament or equivalent legislative organs of each member state.[[147]] Each member State of the AU has five Parliamentarians in the PAP selected from both ruling and opposition parties participating in the national parliaments of member States and at least one of whom must be a woman.[[148]] The tenure of the Parliamentarians in the PAP runs concurrently with their tenure at their national parliament.[[149]] However, the parliamentarians act and vote independently of their national parliament once they are sworn in the PAP.[[150]] In its daily activities the PAP is run by a Bureau composed of a president and four vice-presidents elected from all sub-regions based on equitable geographical representation and supported by a Clerk and deputy Clerks .[[151]]</p>
         <p>The idea behind the establishment of the PAP is the representation of the African people and their grass-root organizations in the deliberations and decisions of the policy organs of the AU.[[152]] The PAP is given the mandate to ‘exercise advisory and consultative powers only’ to the Assembly and to all policy organs of the Union either at the request of the AU organs or at its own initiative.[[153]] In order to carry out its mandate, the PAP is given, inter alia, the power to discuss and make recommendations and pass resolutions on issues of importance and relevance to the continent such as the promotion of peace and security and protection of human rights and democracy.[[154]] The PAP is also given the mandate to issue invitations to the representatives of policy organs of the Union and member States ‘to furnish explanations in plenary on issues affecting or likely to affect the life of the African Union’.[[155]] The members of the PAP are entitled to forward their questions to any policy organ of the AU through the President of the PAP while the President of the PAP can in consultation with the Bureau, invite the Chairperson of the Assembly to explain a decision taken by the Assembly to the PAP.[[156]] The AU Commission is obliged to submit annual report on the activities of the Union to the PAP.[[157]] The PAP meets at least twice a year on ordinary sessions while a request for extraordinary session by two-thirds of the PAP members, the Assembly or the Executive Council of the Union can be made any time.[[158]] All sessions of the PAP are open for the public unless there is the PAP Bureau decides otherwise.[[159]] The President of the PAP attends AU Assembly sessions and presents the reports of the PAP to the Assembly.[[160]] The PAP is operational and sits in South Africa.[[161]] The PAP budget, including the allowances for its members, is part of the overall AU budget.[[162]]</p>
         <h3>4.7 The Court of Justice</h3>
         <p>The Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the Court of Justice of the Union whose statute, composition and functions are defined in a separate protocol.[[163]] The Protocol of the Court of Justice of the AU identifies, inter alia, the eligible parties to submit cases, the jurisdiction of the Court, and sources of law of the Court.[[164]]</p>
         <p>The AU Court of Justice is the ‘principal judicial organ of the Union’ and is given both advisory and contentious jurisdiction.[[165]] Under its contentious jurisdiction, the Court is given competence, inter alia, over all disputes that pertain to the interpretation and application of the AU Constitutive Act, the interpretation and application or validity of all treaties and legal instruments adopted and ratified under the auspices of the AU, over ‘all acts, decisions, regulations and directives of the organs of the Union’ and any treaties between member states of the Union that provides for the jurisdiction of the court.[[166]] The AU Assembly may also confer a special jurisdiction over the Court in addition to its statutory jurisdiction.[[167]] The Court of Justice has got power to make binding decisions on member States and can review the acts of the Union within its contentious jurisdiction.[[168]]</p>
         <p>The formal sources of law of the Court are the AU Constitutive Act, international treaties expressly recognized by contesting states, international custom, and general principles of law; while judicial decisions, the writings of publicists, the AU regulations, directives and decisions are subsidiary means for the determination of the rule of law. [[169]] [The parties eligible to submit cases to the Court are AU member states that have signed and ratified the Protocol establishing the Court, the AU Assembly, the AU Pan-African Parliament, the AU Commission and ‘other organs of the Union authorized by the Assembly.’[[170]] Moreover, staff members of the AU Commission are given the right to submit cases to the AU Court of Justice in a dispute amongst themselves within the limits and conditions of the Staff Rules and Regulations.[[171]] Third parties can also submit cases based on the direction of the Assembly and the concerned state party. [[172]]</p>
         <p>In July 2004, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government decided that the Court of Justice ‘should be integrated into one Court’ with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights citing financial and logistical constraints to establish two different courts. [[173]] The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights is a judicial body as part of the African Human Rights system. The Protocol for the establishment for the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights entered into force on 25 January 2004 while the Protocol on the establishment of the Court of Justice of the AU has not entered into force as of this date. The AU Assembly has decided that the operationalization of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights should continue pending its future merger with the Court of Justice.[[174]] Accordingly the AU Assembly has elected 11 judges for the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and decided the Court should be located in Arusha, Tanzania.[[175]]</p>
         <h3>4.8 The Commission</h3>
         <p>The AU Commission is a permanent organ established by the AU Constitutive Act.[[176]] The Commission is the administrative wing of the AU accountable to the Assembly and the Executive Council.[[177]] The AU Commission is given numerous administrative functions and mandate that include administrating the AU institutions; coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU such as Assembly , the Executive Council , the Peace and Security Council of the Union in collaboration with the organs; providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council; initiating proposals on the budget and wide range of regional issues; organizing and managing meetings and accepting donations and grants that are compatible with the objectives and principles of the Union; and depositing the treaties adopted and ratified under the aegis of the African Union.[[178]]</p>
         <p>The AU Commission is composed of the Chairperson, the deputy Chairperson and eight Commissioners all of whom are appointed by the Assembly based on gender balance and equitable representation of all sub-regions. [[179]] Once appointed, all officials of the AU Commission are only responsible to the AU and not to any government and external authority.[[180]] The officials are assisted by all necessary staff in running the Commission located at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>
         <p>The Chairperson of the Commission is the Chief Executive Officer and legal representative of the AU and is mandated to carry out many essential functions such as the overall responsibility of the finances and administration of the Commission, the preparation of its budget, participating in the meetings of the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and keep records of the deliberations, follow up and report on the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU, appoint staff of the Commission and carry out any function that is assigned to him by the Assembly and the Executive Council.[[181]] The Chairperson is accountable to the Executive Council.[[182]] The Deputy Chairperson is accountable to the Chairperson and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Organization.[[183]]</p>
         <p>The eight Commissioners are accountable to the Chairperson of the Commission and each Commissioner heads one of the eight departments/directorates of the Commission established along the eight portfolios of the Commission.[[184]] The portfolios of the Commission are Political Affairs; Peace and Security; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; and Economic Affairs.[[185]] The Third ordinary session of the Executive Council of the AU maintained the portfolios as departments of the Commission.[[186]] The Executive Council further added a number of directorates and units under the office of the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson. Thus, under the Office of the Chairperson we find the Bureau of the Chairperson, the Directorate for Women, Gender and Development; the Directorate for Strategic Policy Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, International Cooperation and Resource Mobilization; the Communication and Information Unit; and Protocol Services Unit; the NEPAD Coordination Unit; the Secretariat of the CSSDCA; the Office of the Legal Counsel; and the Office of the Internal Auditor.[[187]] The Directorate for Administration and Human Resources Development; the Directorate for Programming, Budgeting, Finance and Accounting; and the Directorate for Conference Services were put under the Office of the Deputy Chairperson. [[188]]</p>
         <h3>4.9 The Economic, Social and Cultural Council</h3>
         <p>The AU Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) is an advisory body composed of representatives of civil society, professional groups and cultural groups both in Africa and in the Diaspora.[[189]] The main idea behind the establishment of the ECOSOCC is the broad participation of the ordinary African citizens through representative civil society organizations and professional groups in the activities of the Union.[[190]] Thus, the main objectives of the ECOSOCC include the participation of the African Civil Society in the promulgation and implementation of the policies and norms of the AU and the development of communication between the ordinary citizens of Africa on common issues of the continent.[[191]] Based on its objectives, the ECOSOCC is given the task of popularization of the AU norms among the citizens of Africa and giving advisory services to the organs of the Union how best to implement the norms and policies of the Organization at its own initiative or at the request of organs of the Union.[[192]] The structures of the ECOSOCC include General Assembly as the highest decision making organ with 150 members of the civil society elected at the level of member states, sub-regions, the continent, the African diaspora and ex-officio members appointed by the commission; the Standing Committee to coordinate the works of the ECOSOCC appointed by its General Assembly; Sectoral Cluster Committees to advise on specific areas; and Credentials Committee.[[193]]</p>
         <p>The AU ECOSOCC was launched on March 27-30, 2005 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at the headquarters of the AU.[[194]] During the launching conference, the Interim General Assembly of the ECOSOCC sworn in Wangari Maathai, Nobel Laureate from Kenya, as the President of the Bureau of the Interim General Assembly of ECOSOCC with four deputies from the center, north, south and west sub-regions.[[195]] The Interim Bureau has established a Standing Committee which held its first meeting in Nairobi, Kenya from April 22-24, 2005 for consultation on the establishment of the required organs of the ECOSOCC.[[196]] The Standing Committee and the Interim General Assembly are in the process of establishing all the post-interim Assembly and all organs of the ECOSOCC.[[197]]</p>
         <h3>4.10 The Financial Institutions</h3>
         <p>The Constitutive Act of the AU envisages the establishment of the African Central Bank, the African Monetary Fund and the African Investment Bank as the three new financial institutions under the Union.[[198]] The rules and regulations for the establishment of the financial institutions are yet to be provided in separate protocols. The fourth ordinary session of the AU Assembly has requested the Chairperson of the Commission to prepare the legal instruments for the establishment of the three financial institutions. [[199]] The same Assembly session has also decided that the African Central Bank should be located in the Western sub-region while the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund should be located in the Northern and Central sub-regions respectively. [[200]] Accordingly Nigeria was selected as the host country for the future African Central Bank while Libya and Cameroon were chosen to host the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund respectively.[[201]] The process of establishing the financial institutions has continued into 2007. [[202]]</p>
         <h3>4.11 The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights</h3>
         <p>The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights forms part of the African regional system of human rights, which has its basis on the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. [[203]] The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights established the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as an organ of implementation of its substantive provisions.[[204]] The AU Constitutive Act does not recognize the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one of the organs of the AU. However, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights was incorporated as an organ of the AU in 2002. [[205]]</p>
         <p>The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is composed of eleven members elected by the AU Executive Committee from member States and appointed by the AU Assembly. [[206]] The members of the Commission serve in their personal capacity. [[207]] The Commission is run by a Secretariat in its daily activities. [[208]] The budget of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is provided by the AU as part of the overall budget of the AU Commission. [[209]]</p>
         <p>The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given three mandates: promotional, protective and interpretative.[[210]] Under the promotional mandate, the Commission works for the awareness of human rights in Africa through different methods such as publication, research on human rights problems in Africa and collaboration with African and other international institutions concerned with the protection of human and peoples’ rights.[[211]] The protective mandate of the Commission generally provides that the Commission shall ‘ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter.’ [[212]] Under the protective mandate, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights examine State reports, inter-state communications, and in limited cases, individual complaints of human rights violations. [[213]]</p>
         <p>The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given the general power to ‘resort to any appropriate method of investigation’ thereby giving it some latitude to adopt investigation methods within the bounds of its protective mandate. [[214]] Consequently, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has developed other important protective functions over the years. The use of fact-finding missions in member States and the appointment of Special Rapporteur on thematic issues of human rights on the continent are the two main protective functions undertaken by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. [[215]] All the above-mentioned protective measures of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights result in reports and recommendations which are communicated to the concerned State parties and to the Assembly of the AU. [[216]] The AU Assembly may request the Commission to make further in-depth investigation if it believes that the report of the Commission indicates serious human rights violations.[[217]] Any measure that may be taken by the Commission within its protective mandate remains confidential until the AU Assembly decides otherwise.[[218]] </p>
         <h2>5. The relation between the AU and sub-regional organizations</h2>
         <p>Currently there are over ten sub-regional organizations in Africa. The African Union recognizes eight sub-regional organizations: Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Common Market of East and Southern Africa (COMESA), Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD), Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), Economic Community of Sahelo-Saharian States (CEN-SAD) and East African Community (EAC).[[219]]</p>
         <p>African sub-regional organizations were initially established as economic communities in their respective sub-region. There is no clear framework to coordinate the economic objectives of the AU with the sub-regional organizations.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the major sub-regional organizations have developed norms and institutions on security. In this regard, the Peace and Security Council Protocol provides that the sub-regional organizations are part and parcel of the continental security architecture.[[220]] The African Common Defense and Security Policy reaffirms that sub-regional organizations are the implementing institutions of the AU norms on the prevention, management and resolution of conflict under the umbrella of the Peace and Security Council.[[221]] Nevertheless, the relationship and hierarchy between the AU and the sub-regional organizations on the issue of the maintenance of peace and security is not yet clearly worked out. In 2005, the AU Commission has launched consultative meetings with the above-mentioned sub-regional organizations in order to work on the details of the Memorandum of Understanding between the AU Peace and Security Council and the sub-regional organizations security mechanisms. [[222]]</p>
         <h2>6. The status of the AU under the UN Charter</h2>
         <p>The UN Charter provides the following characteristics of regional organisations under Article 52(1):</p>
         <p>Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided that such arrangement or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations.</p>
         <p>The words ‘agencies’ or ‘arrangements’ under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter refer to the kind of regional organisation that member States may establish. [[223]] Thus, ‘arrangements’ are organisations based on multilateral treaties among States while ‘agencies’ refer to regional organisations with various kinds of organs of implementation of the multilateral treaties.[[224]] The criteria for determining whether an organisation is a regional organisation under Article 52 (1) of the UN Charter are two:[ [225]]</p>
         <p>When seen against the above criteria, the AU can be characterised as a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter as it is meant to play a role in the maintenance of peace and security in Africa[[226]] and observe the purposes and principles of the UN.[[227]] Moreover, the Protocol for the establishment of the AU Peace and Security Council as well as the various statements of the AU organs indicate that the AU considers itself as a regional organization within the meaning of Article 52(1) of the UN Charter. [[228]] For instance, in its 10th ordinary session, the AU Assembly called upon the UN ‘to examine, within the context of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, the possibility of funding, through assessed contributions, peacekeeping operations undertaken by African Union or under its authority and with the consent of the United Nations.’ [[229]] In its various communications, the UN Security Council has also recognised the AU as a regional organisation within the parameter of the principles laid down in Articles 52 and 53 of the UN Charter.

         <h2>7. The Status of the AU Treaties</h2>
         <p>The transformation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) into the new continental organization of the AU in 2001 makes it necessary to discuss the current status of the treaties that were signed and ratified under the aegis of the OAU. Currently there are 40 treaties under the auspices of the African Union. [[231]] About half of these treaties were adopted under the auspices of OAU, the predecessor of the AU. The treaties adopted under the OAU are assumed by the AU and continue to be binding on those States, which have signed and ratified them. The AU Executive Council and the AU Commission are working on the revision of some of the treaties that were signed and ratified under the aegis of the OAU. [[232]]</p>

This is the case with the United Nations Charter where some countries have withdrawn notwithstanding that it is not mentioned textually. Libya’s proposal is that this right should not be mentioned in the Act, as if states are being invited to withdraw or denounce the Act’. In the text of the same document of the proposed amendment under Article 31, Libya went further than its explanatory notes and stated that Article 31 should be deleted because ‘a state whose policy-making bodies have ratified the Constitutive Act has no grounds to withdraw from the Union, renounce its membership and request that the Act should cease to apply to it.’</p>
