Note About Research Guide 1. Introduction This guide is designed to identify key resources concerning the immigration law of Australia, Canada, and the United States. For each country, this guide will identify key government bodies involved in administering immigration law and organizations involved with immigrants and immigration policy. The guide will also identify select legislation, regulations, case law, secondary sources, fee-based databases and research guides relating to each country’s immigration law and policy. It will report whether each country has acceded to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, two key international conventions concerning refugees. The guide will provide online and print resources for each country’s legislation, regulations, and case law relating to immigration, when available. It will also provide links to select resources relating to refugees for each country. Because of the breadth of the subject area, this guide is not comprehensive but selective. It provides an overview of the resources available and aims to serve as a starting point for those interested in conducting in-depth research in this area. Finally, sources marked with an asterisk were consulted in the preparation of this guide. 2. Australian Immigration Law 2.1 Government Bodies The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) administers Australia’s immigration laws. To that end, DIBP determines whether applicants meet the criteria for visas, enforces the immigration laws, and so on. The DIBP website offers, among other things: “Agents Gateway”: Links and information for migration agents Applications and forms Immigration statistics Information booklets Notices of changes to Australian immigration laws Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, who is also an elected member of Parliament, provides direction regarding DIBP’s administration of the immigration laws. The Minister’s website offers, among other things the Press releases and Minister’s profile. Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Australian Human Rights Commission, and Commonwealth Ombudsman: A number of Australian administrative bodies, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal make decisions concerning various immigration matters. The Australian Human Rights Commission and Commonwealth Ombudsman may also issue decisions and reports relating to Australian immigration. To learn more about these administrative bodes, consult the portion of this guide concerning Australian immigration case law. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration, a joint committee of the Australian Parliament, focuses on proposed changes to Australian immigration legislation and regulations. The Committee website offers information about the Committee, as well as the Committee’s inquiries and reports. 2.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: Procedures Advice Manual and Migration Series Instructions: DIBP spells out its procedures and policies in the Procedures Advice Manual (PAM). The current edition of PAM is PAM3. DIAC also issues Migration Series Instructions (MSIs), which comment on specific issues relevant to immigration legislation and regulations. MSIs are eventually incorporated into the PAM. Ministerial Directions: The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the Minister for Immigration to issue directions to a person or body who has powers or functions under the Migration Act 1958. These directions are usually called Ministerial Directions. Currently, there are a number in effect on a variety of subject matters, ranging from circumstances when DIAC should refuse or cancel a visa to the order in which DIAC should process various types of visa applications.

Sydney: Butterworths, 2004- (publishes PAM, MSIs, and Ministerial Directions). 2.3 Constitutional Provisions The Australian Constitution in §51 authorizes the Australian Parliament to legislate for the “peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to”... “[n]naturalisation and aliens” and “immigration and emigration.” Select Free Online Resources Federal Register of Legislation Parliament of Australia, Senate website 2.4 Legislation, Regulations &amp; Gazette Notices Migration Act 1958: The Migration Act 1958 is currently Australia’s primary legislation concerning immigration. It sets out the law regulating entry and migration to Australia. To that end, it sets out the framework for various types of visas, establishes sanctions for violations of the law, outlines the regulation of migration agents and the judicial review of certain immigration decisions, and so on. The Act was first passed in 1958 but has been amended many times since then. Migration Regulations 1994: The Migration Regulations 1994 are issued pursuant to authority in the Migration Act 1958. These regulations provide details on the immigration law outlined in the Migration Act 1958. For example, the regulations spell out what types of visas are available, how the points system for skilled visa applicants is applied, when visas may be cancelled, and so on. Migration Agents Regulations 1998: The Migration Agents Regulations 1998 are also issued pursuant to authority in the Migration Act 1958. They set out information relating to the regulation of migration agents. For example, these regulations spell out the insurance requirements for migration agents, their continuing professional development obligations, and so on. Australian Citizenship Act 2007: The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 is now the principal legislation governing citizenship. It basically concerns who is a citizen, circumstances causing the loss of citizenship, and so on. Australian Citizenship Regulations 2007: The Australian Citizenship Regulations 2007 largelyinform on procedures relating to obtaining citizenship. Commonwealth of Australia Gazette Notices: The Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations 1994 and other immigration legislation require that certain matters be published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette. For example, the Migration Act 1958 requires that notices be published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette when the annual caps are set for the various classes of visas.

This court was established in 1999 by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999 (Cth) and provides an alternative to the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia and provides relief to the workloads of those courts. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court of Australia (FCA) in a number of areas of general federal law including bankruptcy, human rights, workplace relations and migration matters. Federal Court of Australia: The Federal Court of Australia was established in 1976 by the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and is a superior court of law and equity. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) in a number of areas of general federal law including bankruptcy, human rights, workplace relations and migration matters. According to the Federal Court of Australia Annual Report 2014-15: “In 2014–15 twelve migration cases filed in the Court&#39;s appellate jurisdiction related to judgments of single judges of the Court exercising the Court&#39;s original jurisdiction and 665 migration cases related to judgments of the FCC. These 677 cases include 648 appeals, cross appeals and related actions and twenty-nine interlocutory applications.” High Court of Australia: The High Court of Australia was provided for under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) however was established by the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Original jurisdiction in federal matters is provided under section 75 of the Constitution and appellate jurisdiction is provided under s 73 of the Constitution. According to the High Court of Australia Annual Report 2014-15, “The functions of the High Court are to: interpret and apply the law of Australia decide cases of special federal significance, including challenges to the constitutional validity of laws; and hear appeals, by special leave, from federal, state and territory courts.” In the same annual report, it mentions: “The proportion of civil special leave applications involving immigration matters at 32 per cent was consistent with the 28 per cent in 2013-14. Table D illustrates the number of immigration matters as a proportion of civil special leave applications filed in the past 10 years. Eighty-two per cent of the immigration applications filed in 2014-15 were filed by self-represented litigants.” Administrative Decisions Administrative Appeals Tribunal: The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is an administrative body that reviews a variety of decisions made by Australian agencies. The former Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal were amalgamated into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as of 1 July 2016. The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the AAT to review certain DIAC decisions, such as a decision to deny or cancel a visa on character grounds, certain decisions involving criminal deportations, and so on. The AAT also conducts “merits reviews,” like the MRT and RRT. AAT hearings are generally more formal than hearings at MRT and RRT. Minister for Immigration and Border Protection: The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the Minister to replace a decision of the AAT with one more favorable to the applicant if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. A Migration Series Instruction gives some insight into when this discretion may be exercised. The Commonwealth Ombudsman: The Commonwealth Ombudsman responds to complaints of unfair treatment against the Australian Government, including the DIAC. The Ombudsman does not have the authority to overturn DIAC decisions but it can negotiate disputes and recommend that the DIAC change its decisions and practices. Generally, the Ombudsman will review cases only after other avenues of review have been exhausted. When reviewing immigration and detention matters, the Commonwealth Ombudsman may use the title Immigration Ombudsman. The Australian Human Rights Commission: The Australian Human Rights Commission administers complaints of discrimination under these laws: Racial Discrimination Act 1975, Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and Age Discrimination Act 2004. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commission investigates allegations of human rights violations under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986. Like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Human Rights Commission cannot overturn DIAC decisions but it can recommend that the DIAC change its decisions and practices. The Commission website offers news, reports, and information on issues relating to immigration and refugees. AHRC has reported on issues beyond individual cases e.g. The forgotten children: National inquiry into children in immigration detention, 2014.

In addition, the IARC provides immigration advice to low-income individuals and is involved in education on migration issues. The IARC website offers policy materials and information sheets on numerous immigration topics. The Migration Institute of Australia is a professional organization for migration agents. The organization offers continuing education opportunities for agents, as well as legislative advocacy for the profession. The Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) regulates the migration agents industry. The Migration Act 1958 spells out MARA’s powers and responsibilities. The MARA is responsible for maintaining a registry of agents, administering the registration of agents, investigating allegations against migration agents, and disciplining agents who are found to have violated certain rules. The MARA website offers, among other things: Code of Conduct for Registered Migration Agents Migration Agent and Immigration Lawyer Directory MARA discipline decisions Refugee Council of Australia is a non-profit organization that advocates for various refugee communities in Australia and advises and provides support to refugees. 2.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Convention) and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugee (Protocol) are often referred to as the “principal international instruments that provide protection to persons fleeing persecution.”[3] Australia acceded to the Convention on January 22, 1954, and acceded to the Protocol on December 13, 1973. The Migration Act 1958 spells out the “process or manner” in which Australia implements its obligations under the Convention and Protocol.[4] Select Free Online Resources Asylumlaw.org website: Summary of Australian refugee law DIAC website: Forms, information, and publications on Australia’s refugee and humanitarian program DIAC website: Information on support for refugees and other humanitarian entrants In addition, several of the print resources referenced in the Secondary Sources portion of this guide discuss Australian refugee law and procedures.

Canadian Immigration Law 3.1 Government Bodies Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada, is the primary Canadian agency responsible for administering Canadian immigration laws. In this capacity, CIC issues visas, makes certain eligibility determinations on refugee claims, runs programs designed to help new immigrants, and so on. The IRCC website offers, among other things: Applications and forms Media Centre Research and statistics materials The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has a broad mandate that includes the protection of Canada’s borders. Among other things, the Canada Border Services Agency plays a role in enforcing Canadian immigration laws by screening immigrants and refugees and investigating possible breaches of Canadian immigration law. Immigration legislation (described below) sets out the division of responsibilities between IRCC and CBSA. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) renders decisions on a variety of immigration matters, including deciding refugee claims made in Canada, hearing appeals of certain IRCC decisions, and conducting admissibility hearings. The Board consists of four divisions: the Refugee Protection Division, the Refugee Appeal Division, the Immigration Division and the Immigration Appeal Division. For further information on the jurisdiction of the IRB, consult the case law portion of this guide, below. 3.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: Operational Manuals: Operational Manuals provide guidance for IRCC employees. They are intended to provide relatively comprehensive information to decision-makers on all areas of IRCC jurisdiction and some matters touching on CBSA responsibilities, particularly those related to immigration enforcement. Topic areas of the manuals include but are not limited to: Citizenship Policy, Enforcement, Temporary Foreign Workers Guidelines, Immigration Legislation, Refugee Protection and Overseas Processing. Note that as of the currency date of this publication, IRCC was in the midst of “modernizing” the format of these manuals, shifting from PDF documents to HTML webpages. Operational Bulletins: IRCC also occasionally issues Operational Bulletins for “one-time-only instructions or to provide urgent instructions to staff for a brief period while the relevant program and policy chapters of the Manuals are being updated.”[5] Select Free Online Resources IRCC website: Operational Manuals IRCC website: Operational Bulletins and Manual Updates 3.3 Constitutional Provisions The Constitution Act, 1867 in § 95 confers concurrent powers in immigration matters to both the Federal and Provincial governments. Specifically, the Constitution says that each Province may make laws relating to immigration into the Province and that the Parliament may make laws relating to immigration into “all or any of the Provinces.” In addition, the Constitution specifies that law of a Province “shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.” The result of the above is that while several provinces maintain their own immigration schemes, primarily aimed at attracting skilled labour and addressing labour shortages, ultimate responsibility for Canada’s immigration scheme resides with the federal government. In addition to the above division of powers contemplated by the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution Act, 1982 brought into existence the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application of the Charter’s protections to immigration legislation and to non-citizens has been the subject of a now significant body of jurisprudence Online Versions of Canadian Constitution Constitution Acts: CanLII version, Department of Justice version Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: CanLII version, Department of Justice version 3.4 Legislation, Regulations &amp; Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is the framework legislation that sets out principles of Canadian immigration and refugee law. The IRPA came into force in 2001, though it has been amended on a number of occasions since that time. The IRPA brought with it several notable changes to Canadian immigration law, such as modifying the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s jurisdiction, incorporating commitments under the Convention Against Torture and increasing the emphasis on criminality, security and inadmissibility. Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), issued pursuant to the IRPA, provide details on that law. For example, the IRPR specify how long a permanent resident card is valid for and what must be done to appeal a removal order. Citizenship Act sets out the law of Canadian citizenship. Specifically, the Citizenship Act establishes the requirements that must be met to qualify for Canadian citizenship, the situations where Canadian citizenship can be lost, the procedures that the CIC must follow when processing citizenship applications, and so on. Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements: The IRPA authorizes the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration to enter into agreements with Provinces and Territories concerning immigration. The Government of Canada has signed comprehensive agreements concerning immigration matters with Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Québec, Saskatchewan and Yukon.[6] One of these agreements, the Canada-Québec Accord, Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens, gives Québec broad autonomy over the selection of immigrants to Québec and integration services for new immigrants. Some of the other immigration agreements between Canada and the Provinces and Territories are called Provincial Nominee agreements. These agreements, among other things, permit the Province or Territory to nominate particular immigrants for permanent residence status to fulfill the Province’s or Territory’s specific labor needs. The CIC website offers information and copies of these agreements.

As noted above, it is responsible for making a range of decisions relating to immigration and refugee matters. The IRB currently consists of four divisions: the Immigration Division, Immigration Appeal Division, Refugee Protection Division, and the Refugee Appeal Division. The Immigration Division conducts certain admissibility hearings and detention reviews. The Immigration Appeal Division conducts appeals on immigration matters, including appeals of rejected sponsorship applications, appeals of certain removal orders, and appeals of certain decisions relating to residency obligations. The Refugee Protection Division adjudicates refugee claims brought by persons in Canada after an officer has made a preliminary determination that the claim is eligible to be heard by the IRB. Finally, the Refugee Appeal Division hears appeals of RPD decisions. Each Division has rules that govern its operations.

Judicial Decisions: While there are various appellate mechanisms built into immigration legislation (most notably the appeals provided by the Immigration Appeal Division and the Refugee Appeal Division), recourse for other immigration decisions occurs by way of an application for leave and judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada. Sections 72-74 of the IRPA sets out the requirements and limitations of judicial review under immigration law. The most significant limitation on judicial review is that it may not be brought as of right, but is subject to the leave of the court: see IRPA s. 72(1). Appeals of Federal Court judicial review decisions (though not decisions on leave) may be brought to the Federal Court of Appeal, but only where the Federal Court justice who has presided over the matter certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question: IRPA s. 74(d).

CARL carries out its work promoting the human rights of refugees in the courts, before parliamentary committees, in the media, among its membership via bi-annual conferences, and elsewhere in the public sphere. The Canadian Council for Refugees is a national non-profit umbrella organization committed to the rights and protection of refugees and other vulnerable migrants in Canada and around the world and to the settlement of refugees and immigrants in Canada. The membership is made up of organizations involved in the settlement, sponsorship and protection of refugees and immigrants. The Council serves the networking, information-exchange and advocacy needs of its membership. Community Legal Education Ontario is a “community legal clinic ... that specializes in public legal education.”[8] The Community Legal Education Ontario website offers a number of publications relating to immigration, including Criminal Charges in Canada and your Immigration Status, Being Arrested and Detained for Immigration Reasons, Making a Refugee Claim, Sponsoring a Member of the Family Class, and Your Status as a Permanent Resident. 3.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers Canada acceded to the Convention and the Protocol on June 4, 1969. For information on the Convention and Protocol, see the Section I.9 of this guide. The IRPA is the primary means Canada uses to implement its obligations to refugees.

Brookman, S. Research Guide: Immigration and Refugee Law (posted on Osgoode Hall Law School Library website). 4. United States Immigration Law 4.1 Government Bodies United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a sub-agency in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), administers U.S. immigration benefits. USCIS is responsible for reviewing various types of immigrant and nonimmigrant visa petitions, adjudicating asylum claims, processing applications for citizenship as well as employment authorization, etc. The USCIS website offers, among other things: Information on applying for immigrant visas which grant lawful permanent residence (also commonly known as “Green Cards”) USCIS Press room Homepage for various USCIS application and petition forms U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security In addition to USCIS, two other sub-agencies within DHS are involved in administering and enforcing other aspects of the U.S. immigration system and laws: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP is responsible for policing U.S. borders and returning some recent unauthorized border crossers, and has a role in reviewing some visa applicants’ information and documentation, and CBP agents ultimately decide whom to admit into the United States at ports of entry after reviewing information and documentation provided by those seeking to enter the United States. CBP also reviews petitions and issues nonimmigrant statuses to some nonimmigrant visa applicants, including for Canadian nationals in the TN and L-1 visa classifications. ICE performs immigration-related investigations, enforcement, and removal operations that are primarily conducted from within the interior of the United States, as well as workplace audits and raids to detect unauthorized workers. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) is the primary U.S. agency responsible for conducting foreign affairs. In this capacity, DOS has numerous functions, including processing visas and U.S. passports, as well as administering the J-1 visa Exchange Visitor Program. The DOS website offers a number of resources, including information about the different visas issued by DOS, as well as data on immigrant and nonimmigrant visas issued and processing times: Glossary of visa terms Information about U.S. visas Visa application forms Visa statistics Nonimmigrant Visa Statistics Visa appointment and processing wait times Visa Bulletin (priority dates for immigrant visas) U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, Employment and Training Administration The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)’s primary roles in the administration of U.S. immigration laws—through the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), an office in DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA)—are to review and certify applications for permanent labor certification for employment-based immigrant visas, and labor certifications and labor condition applications (LCA) for nonimmigrant work visas. For many types of employment-based immigration, U.S. employers must request first that the DOL approve a labor certification request before USCIS may issue an immigrant visa or adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. This process is designed to assure that a U.S. employer’s hiring of a foreign worker for a particular position will not adversely affect U.S. workers. The goal of the labor certification process in the nonimmigrant context for H-2A and H-2B visas is similar, i.e. to protect U.S. workers from negative impacts on their wages and working conditions.The DOL website offers, among other things: Foreign labor certification forms Overview of foreign labor certification rules and processes PERM: Electronic system for filing labor certification applications OFLC Performance Data (contains annual reports and statistics on labor certifications and LCAs) U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division The DOL’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is the U.S. government’s primary labor standards enforcement agency. It is tasked with enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act and a number of other federal statutes related to wages and labor standards, and as its mission statement notes, WHD is also tasked with enforcing “a number of employment standards and worker protections as provided in several immigration related statutes” including the protections for migrant and U.S. workers in the H-2A, H-2B, and H-1B temporary foreign worker programs. WHD’s website offers a number of useful fact sheets that describe the rules and procedures in U.S. work visa programs and provide detailed information about labor standards under U.S. law: WHD fact sheet page Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), an office in the U.S. Department of Justice, adjudicates many types of immigration cases. The EOIR consists of three offices that issue administrative decisions involving immigration: Immigration Courts, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the Office of Chief Administrative Hearing Officer. For more information on the EOIR, consult the portion of this research guide concerning U.S. immigration case law. 4.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: The USCIS Policy Memorandasection online contains documents that “provide[] access to various policy and procedural memoranda which gives guidance to USCIS adjudicators in their work of processing applications and petitions for immigration benefits.” The USCIS Policy Manual “is the agency’s centralized online repository for USCIS’ immigration policies. The USCIS Policy Manual will ultimately replace the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM), the USCIS Immigration Policy Memoranda site, and other policy repositories.” The Adjudicators Field Manual, according to USCIS, “comprehensively details USCIS policies and procedures for adjudicating applications and petitions.” The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) is a multi-volume text that details the DOS’s policies and structure and provides instruction and interpretive guidance on visas and other matters for DOS employees. Volume 9 of the FAM contains material relating to visas. The DOS’s Visa Bulletin reports on the availability of family- and employment-based immigrant visas for permanent residence during the month that the bulletin is published. Immigrant visas are either immediately available or require that the applicant wait until a visa becomes available due to the visa backlog for applicants from certain countries and in certain preference categories (or a combination of both). This information on the Visa Bulletin can provide useful insight into whether visas in a particular category are available and how long applicants will have to wait.

Immigration Law and Procedure. LexisNexis, 1966-. 4.3 Constitutional Provisions The U.S. Constitution does not include a specific provision concerning immigration. The Supreme Court has generally held that Congress has “plenary power”, or wide authority to legislate on immigration. This authority is based on numerous grounds, including the Constitutional provision authorizing Congress to legislate on naturalization, Congress’s foreign relations and international commerce authority, and the Federal government’s inherent power as a sovereign to control its borders. 4.4 Legislation, Regulations, &amp; Documents in the Federal Register The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (INA) is the primary statute governing U.S. immigration law. The INA is codified in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, Aliens and Nationality. In addition to Title 8, some other titles of the U.S. Code contain provisions relating to immigration, including Title 20, Employee Benefits, Title 22, Foreign Relations, and Title 29, Labor. Legislation Amending INA: Several public laws have amended the INA since it was first passed in 1952. These laws include the Immigration Reform Control Act of 1986, Immigration Act of 1990, and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, among many others. Immigration Regulations: Title 8, Aliens and Nationality, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)is the main source for immigration regulations. However, several other titles of the CFR, including Title 6, Domestic Security, and Title 22, Foreign Relations, also contain provisions relating to immigration. Immigration Documents in Federal Register: The Federal Register publishes various government documents and notices issued by federal agencies. Documents relating to immigration that can be found in the Federal Register include proposed, final, and interim final regulations, as well as notices of new immigration rules.

In removal proceedings, Immigration Judges decide whether a foreign national must be removed from the United States or if they are entitled to a benefit under U.S. law or a form of relief from deportation. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), part of the EOIR, conducts appeals in certain immigration matters, including appeals from certain immigration court decisions and appeals from some types of decisions made by DHS District Directors. There are three types of BIA decisions: precedent decisions, indexed decisions, and unpublished decisions. Precedent decisions are those that the BIA selects as having a binding effect on DHS employees and immigration courts, and can be found on EOIR’s website. Indexed decisions can be used for guidance in some circumstances and unpublished decisions are generally considered routine. The BIA Practice Manual provides extensive information about the BIA’s operation. The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO), part of USCIS, primarily hears appeals from decisions made by DHS officers on various types of immigration petitions and applications. USCIS publishes online a select number of decisions, called “Adopted AAO Decisions,” which are non-binding precedent decisions that USCIS has adopted as “binding policy guidance for USCIS personnel. The Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO), part of EOIR, hears cases involving certain complaints of unfair immigration-related employment practices and document fraud. The Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA), part of DOL, hears appeals in cases where DOL has denied a labor certification application. The BALCA Judges’ Benchbook (also called the BALCA Deskbook) provides an overview of labor certification law and offers numerous case citations to back -up its explanations of various points of law.

For example, both have databases of immigration case law, titles of the U.S. Code relating to immigration, immigration regulations, immigration administrative decisions (AAO, BIA, OCAHO, and BALCA decisions), and a range of secondary sources covering immigration. AILALink is an online searchable and constantly updated database that is focused exclusively on immigration law and policy. AILALink is maintained by the American Immigration Lawyers Association. A subscription fee is required. 4.8 Organizations The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) is a professional organization for immigration lawyers. It offers members materials and educational resources designed to assist their practices. AILA website posts the text of proposed immigration legislation, enacted immigration legislation, congressional statements and testimony relating to immigration, and so on. Some materials on the website are restricted to members of the Association. The American Immigration Council (AIC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that does litigation, provides public information, and runs a cultural exchange work program. AIC’s website offers a number of documents with background information as well as a blog, Immigration Impact. The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) is one of the best-known NGOs in the United States focusing on immigrants’ rights. NILC does impact litigation and policy analysis and advocacy focusing on immigration law, and other areas of the law that impact low-income immigrants, including labor and employment law and health care. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the rights of and serving the needs of refugees. The U.S. Committee for Refugees website offers various materials—articles, reports, manuals, and more—targeted to lawyers practicing in this subject area. 4.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees(Convention) and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (Protocol) establish the rules under international law for refugees and asylum-seekers. On November 1, 1968, the United States acceded to the Protocol and is bound it. For more information on the Protocol, see the Section I.9 of this guide. Currently, the INA is the primary source of U.S. asylum and refugee law, and the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980 is an amendment to the INA that serves as the main implementing legislation for the Protocol.

Note About Research Guide 1. Introduction This guide is designed to identify key resources concerning the immigration law of Australia, Canada, and the United States. For each country, this guide will identify key government bodies involved in administering immigration law and organizations involved with immigrants and immigration policy. The guide will also identify select legislation, regulations, case law, secondary sources, fee-based databases and research guides relating to each country’s immigration law and policy. It will report whether each country has acceded to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, two key international conventions concerning refugees. The guide will provide online and print resources for each country’s legislation, regulations, and case law relating to immigration, when available. It will also provide links to select resources relating to refugees for each country. Because of the breadth of the subject area, this guide is not comprehensive but selective. It provides an overview of the resources available and aims to serve as a starting point for those interested in conducting in-depth research in this area. Finally, sources marked with an asterisk were consulted in the preparation of this guide. 2. Australian Immigration Law 2.1 Government Bodies The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) administers Australia’s immigration laws. To that end, DIBP determines whether applicants meet the criteria for visas, enforces the immigration laws, and so on. The DIBP website offers, among other things: “Agents Gateway”: Links and information for migration agents Applications and forms Immigration statistics Information booklets Notices of changes to Australian immigration laws Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, who is also an elected member of Parliament, provides direction regarding DIBP’s administration of the immigration laws. The Minister’s website offers, among other things the Press releases and Minister’s profile. Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Australian Human Rights Commission, and Commonwealth Ombudsman: A number of Australian administrative bodies, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal make decisions concerning various immigration matters. The Australian Human Rights Commission and Commonwealth Ombudsman may also issue decisions and reports relating to Australian immigration. To learn more about these administrative bodes, consult the portion of this guide concerning Australian immigration case law. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration, a joint committee of the Australian Parliament, focuses on proposed changes to Australian immigration legislation and regulations. The Committee website offers information about the Committee, as well as the Committee’s inquiries and reports. 2.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: Procedures Advice Manual and Migration Series Instructions: DIBP spells out its procedures and policies in the Procedures Advice Manual (PAM). The current edition of PAM is PAM3. DIAC also issues Migration Series Instructions (MSIs), which comment on specific issues relevant to immigration legislation and regulations. MSIs are eventually incorporated into the PAM. Ministerial Directions: The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the Minister for Immigration to issue directions to a person or body who has powers or functions under the Migration Act 1958. These directions are usually called Ministerial Directions. Currently, there are a number in effect on a variety of subject matters, ranging from circumstances when DIAC should refuse or cancel a visa to the order in which DIAC should process various types of visa applications.

It sets out the law regulating entry and migration to Australia. To that end, it sets out the framework for various types of visas, establishes sanctions for violations of the law, outlines the regulation of migration agents and the judicial review of certain immigration decisions, and so on. The Act was first passed in 1958 but has been amended many times since then. Migration Regulations 1994: The Migration Regulations 1994 are issued pursuant to authority in the Migration Act 1958. These regulations provide details on the immigration law outlined in the Migration Act 1958. For example, the regulations spell out what types of visas are available, how the points system for skilled visa applicants is applied, when visas may be cancelled, and so on. Migration Agents Regulations 1998: The Migration Agents Regulations 1998 are also issued pursuant to authority in the Migration Act 1958. They set out information relating to the regulation of migration agents. For example, these regulations spell out the insurance requirements for migration agents, their continuing professional development obligations, and so on. Australian Citizenship Act 2007: The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 is now the principal legislation governing citizenship. It basically concerns who is a citizen, circumstances causing the loss of citizenship, and so on. Australian Citizenship Regulations 2007: The Australian Citizenship Regulations 2007 largelyinform on procedures relating to obtaining citizenship. Commonwealth of Australia Gazette Notices: The Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations 1994 and other immigration legislation require that certain matters be published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette. For example, the Migration Act 1958 requires that notices be published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette when the annual caps are set for the various classes of visas.

This court was established in 1999 by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999 (Cth) and provides an alternative to the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia and provides relief to the workloads of those courts. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court of Australia (FCA) in a number of areas of general federal law including bankruptcy, human rights, workplace relations and migration matters. Federal Court of Australia: The Federal Court of Australia was established in 1976 by the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and is a superior court of law and equity. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) in a number of areas of general federal law including bankruptcy, human rights, workplace relations and migration matters. According to the Federal Court of Australia Annual Report 2014-15: “In 2014–15 twelve migration cases filed in the Court&#39;s appellate jurisdiction related to judgments of single judges of the Court exercising the Court&#39;s original jurisdiction and 665 migration cases related to judgments of the FCC. These 677 cases include 648 appeals, cross appeals and related actions and twenty-nine interlocutory applications.” High Court of Australia: The High Court of Australia was provided for under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) however was established by the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Original jurisdiction in federal matters is provided under section 75 of the Constitution and appellate jurisdiction is provided under s 73 of the Constitution. According to the High Court of Australia Annual Report 2014-15, “The functions of the High Court are to: interpret and apply the law of Australia decide cases of special federal significance, including challenges to the constitutional validity of laws; and hear appeals, by special leave, from federal, state and territory courts.” In the same annual report, it mentions: “The proportion of civil special leave applications involving immigration matters at 32 per cent was consistent with the 28 per cent in 2013-14. Table D illustrates the number of immigration matters as a proportion of civil special leave applications filed in the past 10 years. Eighty-two per cent of the immigration applications filed in 2014-15 were filed by self-represented litigants.” Administrative Decisions Administrative Appeals Tribunal: The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is an administrative body that reviews a variety of decisions made by Australian agencies. The former Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal were amalgamated into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as of 1 July 2016. The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the AAT to review certain DIAC decisions, such as a decision to deny or cancel a visa on character grounds, certain decisions involving criminal deportations, and so on. The AAT also conducts “merits reviews,” like the MRT and RRT. AAT hearings are generally more formal than hearings at MRT and RRT. Minister for Immigration and Border Protection: The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the Minister to replace a decision of the AAT with one more favorable to the applicant if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. A Migration Series Instruction gives some insight into when this discretion may be exercised. The Commonwealth Ombudsman: The Commonwealth Ombudsman responds to complaints of unfair treatment against the Australian Government, including the DIAC. The Ombudsman does not have the authority to overturn DIAC decisions but it can negotiate disputes and recommend that the DIAC change its decisions and practices. Generally, the Ombudsman will review cases only after other avenues of review have been exhausted. When reviewing immigration and detention matters, the Commonwealth Ombudsman may use the title Immigration Ombudsman. The Australian Human Rights Commission: The Australian Human Rights Commission administers complaints of discrimination under these laws: Racial Discrimination Act 1975, Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and Age Discrimination Act 2004. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commission investigates allegations of human rights violations under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986. Like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Human Rights Commission cannot overturn DIAC decisions but it can recommend that the DIAC change its decisions and practices. The Commission website offers news, reports, and information on issues relating to immigration and refugees. AHRC has reported on issues beyond individual cases e.g. The forgotten children: National inquiry into children in immigration detention, 2014.

The IARC website offers policy materials and information sheets on numerous immigration topics. The Migration Institute of Australia is a professional organization for migration agents. The organization offers continuing education opportunities for agents, as well as legislative advocacy for the profession. The Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) regulates the migration agents industry. The Migration Act 1958 spells out MARA’s powers and responsibilities. The MARA is responsible for maintaining a registry of agents, administering the registration of agents, investigating allegations against migration agents, and disciplining agents who are found to have violated certain rules. The MARA website offers, among other things: Code of Conduct for Registered Migration Agents Migration Agent and Immigration Lawyer Directory MARA discipline decisions Refugee Council of Australia is a non-profit organization that advocates for various refugee communities in Australia and advises and provides support to refugees. 2.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Convention) and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugee (Protocol) are often referred to as the “principal international instruments that provide protection to persons fleeing persecution.”[3] Australia acceded to the Convention on January 22, 1954, and acceded to the Protocol on December 13, 1973. The Migration Act 1958 spells out the “process or manner” in which Australia implements its obligations under the Convention and Protocol.[4] Select Free Online Resources Asylumlaw.org website: Summary of Australian refugee law DIAC website: Forms, information, and publications on Australia’s refugee and humanitarian program DIAC website: Information on support for refugees and other humanitarian entrants In addition, several of the print resources referenced in the Secondary Sources portion of this guide discuss Australian refugee law and procedures. For more information on international refugee law resources, see Elisa Mason’s Guide to International Refugee Law Resources on the Web and Colin Fong’s Researching the Legal Aspects of Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 2.10 Research Guides The following research guides concern Australian immigration law: Immigration &amp; Citizenship Law (posted on Parliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia website). 3. Canadian Immigration Law 3.1 Government Bodies Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada, is the primary Canadian agency responsible for administering Canadian immigration laws. In this capacity, CIC issues visas, makes certain eligibility determinations on refugee claims, runs programs designed to help new immigrants, and so on. The IRCC website offers, among other things: Applications and forms Media Centre Research and statistics materials The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has a broad mandate that includes the protection of Canada’s borders. Among other things, the Canada Border Services Agency plays a role in enforcing Canadian immigration laws by screening immigrants and refugees and investigating possible breaches of Canadian immigration law. Immigration legislation (described below) sets out the division of responsibilities between IRCC and CBSA. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) renders decisions on a variety of immigration matters, including deciding refugee claims made in Canada, hearing appeals of certain IRCC decisions, and conducting admissibility hearings. The Board consists of four divisions: the Refugee Protection Division, the Refugee Appeal Division, the Immigration Division and the Immigration Appeal Division. For further information on the jurisdiction of the IRB, consult the case law portion of this guide, below. 3.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: Operational Manuals: Operational Manuals provide guidance for IRCC employees. They are intended to provide relatively comprehensive information to decision-makers on all areas of IRCC jurisdiction and some matters touching on CBSA responsibilities, particularly those related to immigration enforcement. Topic areas of the manuals include but are not limited to: Citizenship Policy, Enforcement, Temporary Foreign Workers Guidelines, Immigration Legislation, Refugee Protection and Overseas Processing. Note that as of the currency date of this publication, IRCC was in the midst of “modernizing” the format of these manuals, shifting from PDF documents to HTML webpages. Operational Bulletins: IRCC also occasionally issues Operational Bulletins for “one-time-only instructions or to provide urgent instructions to staff for a brief period while the relevant program and policy chapters of the Manuals are being updated.”[5] Select Free Online Resources IRCC website: Operational Manuals IRCC website: Operational Bulletins and Manual Updates 3.3 Constitutional Provisions The Constitution Act, 1867 in § 95 confers concurrent powers in immigration matters to both the Federal and Provincial governments. Specifically, the Constitution says that each Province may make laws relating to immigration into the Province and that the Parliament may make laws relating to immigration into “all or any of the Provinces.” In addition, the Constitution specifies that law of a Province “shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.” The result of the above is that while several provinces maintain their own immigration schemes, primarily aimed at attracting skilled labour and addressing labour shortages, ultimate responsibility for Canada’s immigration scheme resides with the federal government. In addition to the above division of powers contemplated by the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution Act, 1982 brought into existence the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application of the Charter’s protections to immigration legislation and to non-citizens has been the subject of a now significant body of jurisprudence Online Versions of Canadian Constitution Constitution Acts: CanLII version, Department of Justice version Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: CanLII version, Department of Justice version 3.4 Legislation, Regulations &amp; Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is the framework legislation that sets out principles of Canadian immigration and refugee law. The IRPA came into force in 2001, though it has been amended on a number of occasions since that time. The IRPA brought with it several notable changes to Canadian immigration law, such as modifying the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s jurisdiction, incorporating commitments under the Convention Against Torture and increasing the emphasis on criminality, security and inadmissibility. Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), issued pursuant to the IRPA, provide details on that law. For example, the IRPR specify how long a permanent resident card is valid for and what must be done to appeal a removal order. Citizenship Act sets out the law of Canadian citizenship. Specifically, the Citizenship Act establishes the requirements that must be met to qualify for Canadian citizenship, the situations where Canadian citizenship can be lost, the procedures that the CIC must follow when processing citizenship applications, and so on. Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements: The IRPA authorizes the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration to enter into agreements with Provinces and Territories concerning immigration. The Government of Canada has signed comprehensive agreements concerning immigration matters with Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Québec, Saskatchewan and Yukon.[6] One of these agreements, the Canada-Québec Accord, Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens, gives Québec broad autonomy over the selection of immigrants to Québec and integration services for new immigrants. Some of the other immigration agreements between Canada and the Provinces and Territories are called Provincial Nominee agreements. These agreements, among other things, permit the Province or Territory to nominate particular immigrants for permanent residence status to fulfill the Province’s or Territory’s specific labor needs. The CIC website offers information and copies of these agreements.

As noted above, it is responsible for making a range of decisions relating to immigration and refugee matters. The IRB currently consists of four divisions: the Immigration Division, Immigration Appeal Division, Refugee Protection Division, and the Refugee Appeal Division. The Immigration Division conducts certain admissibility hearings and detention reviews. The Immigration Appeal Division conducts appeals on immigration matters, including appeals of rejected sponsorship applications, appeals of certain removal orders, and appeals of certain decisions relating to residency obligations. The Refugee Protection Division adjudicates refugee claims brought by persons in Canada after an officer has made a preliminary determination that the claim is eligible to be heard by the IRB. Finally, the Refugee Appeal Division hears appeals of RPD decisions. Each Division has rules that govern its operations.

Judicial Decisions: While there are various appellate mechanisms built into immigration legislation (most notably the appeals provided by the Immigration Appeal Division and the Refugee Appeal Division), recourse for other immigration decisions occurs by way of an application for leave and judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada. Sections 72-74 of the IRPA sets out the requirements and limitations of judicial review under immigration law. The most significant limitation on judicial review is that it may not be brought as of right, but is subject to the leave of the court: see IRPA s. 72(1). Appeals of Federal Court judicial review decisions (though not decisions on leave) may be brought to the Federal Court of Appeal, but only where the Federal Court justice who has presided over the matter certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question: IRPA s. 74(d).

Brookman, S. Research Guide: Immigration and Refugee Law (posted on Osgoode Hall Law School Library website). 4. United States Immigration Law 4.1 Government Bodies United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a sub-agency in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), administers U.S. immigration benefits. USCIS is responsible for reviewing various types of immigrant and nonimmigrant visa petitions, adjudicating asylum claims, processing applications for citizenship as well as employment authorization, etc. The USCIS website offers, among other things: Information on applying for immigrant visas which grant lawful permanent residence (also commonly known as “Green Cards”) USCIS Press room Homepage for various USCIS application and petition forms U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security In addition to USCIS, two other sub-agencies within DHS are involved in administering and enforcing other aspects of the U.S. immigration system and laws: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP is responsible for policing U.S. borders and returning some recent unauthorized border crossers, and has a role in reviewing some visa applicants’ information and documentation, and CBP agents ultimately decide whom to admit into the United States at ports of entry after reviewing information and documentation provided by those seeking to enter the United States. CBP also reviews petitions and issues nonimmigrant statuses to some nonimmigrant visa applicants, including for Canadian nationals in the TN and L-1 visa classifications. ICE performs immigration-related investigations, enforcement, and removal operations that are primarily conducted from within the interior of the United States, as well as workplace audits and raids to detect unauthorized workers. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) is the primary U.S. agency responsible for conducting foreign affairs. In this capacity, DOS has numerous functions, including processing visas and U.S. passports, as well as administering the J-1 visa Exchange Visitor Program. The DOS website offers a number of resources, including information about the different visas issued by DOS, as well as data on immigrant and nonimmigrant visas issued and processing times: Glossary of visa terms Information about U.S. visas Visa application forms Visa statistics Nonimmigrant Visa Statistics Visa appointment and processing wait times Visa Bulletin (priority dates for immigrant visas) U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, Employment and Training Administration The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)’s primary roles in the administration of U.S. immigration laws—through the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), an office in DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA)—are to review and certify applications for permanent labor certification for employment-based immigrant visas, and labor certifications and labor condition applications (LCA) for nonimmigrant work visas. For many types of employment-based immigration, U.S. employers must request first that the DOL approve a labor certification request before USCIS may issue an immigrant visa or adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. This process is designed to assure that a U.S. employer’s hiring of a foreign worker for a particular position will not adversely affect U.S. workers. The goal of the labor certification process in the nonimmigrant context for H-2A and H-2B visas is similar, i.e. to protect U.S. workers from negative impacts on their wages and working conditions.The DOL website offers, among other things: Foreign labor certification forms Overview of foreign labor certification rules and processes PERM: Electronic system for filing labor certification applications OFLC Performance Data (contains annual reports and statistics on labor certifications and LCAs) U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division The DOL’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is the U.S. government’s primary labor standards enforcement agency. It is tasked with enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act and a number of other federal statutes related to wages and labor standards, and as its mission statement notes, WHD is also tasked with enforcing “a number of employment standards and worker protections as provided in several immigration related statutes” including the protections for migrant and U.S. workers in the H-2A, H-2B, and H-1B temporary foreign worker programs. WHD’s website offers a number of useful fact sheets that describe the rules and procedures in U.S. work visa programs and provide detailed information about labor standards under U.S. law: WHD fact sheet page Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), an office in the U.S. Department of Justice, adjudicates many types of immigration cases. The EOIR consists of three offices that issue administrative decisions involving immigration: Immigration Courts, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the Office of Chief Administrative Hearing Officer. For more information on the EOIR, consult the portion of this research guide concerning U.S. immigration case law. 4.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: The USCIS Policy Memorandasection online contains documents that “provide[] access to various policy and procedural memoranda which gives guidance to USCIS adjudicators in their work of processing applications and petitions for immigration benefits.” The USCIS Policy Manual “is the agency’s centralized online repository for USCIS’ immigration policies. The USCIS Policy Manual will ultimately replace the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM), the USCIS Immigration Policy Memoranda site, and other policy repositories.” The Adjudicators Field Manual, according to USCIS, “comprehensively details USCIS policies and procedures for adjudicating applications and petitions.” The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) is a multi-volume text that details the DOS’s policies and structure and provides instruction and interpretive guidance on visas and other matters for DOS employees. Volume 9 of the FAM contains material relating to visas. The DOS’s Visa Bulletin reports on the availability of family- and employment-based immigrant visas for permanent residence during the month that the bulletin is published. Immigrant visas are either immediately available or require that the applicant wait until a visa becomes available due to the visa backlog for applicants from certain countries and in certain preference categories (or a combination of both). This information on the Visa Bulletin can provide useful insight into whether visas in a particular category are available and how long applicants will have to wait.

Immigration Law and Procedure. LexisNexis, 1966-. 4.3 Constitutional Provisions The U.S. Constitution does not include a specific provision concerning immigration. The Supreme Court has generally held that Congress has “plenary power”, or wide authority to legislate on immigration. This authority is based on numerous grounds, including the Constitutional provision authorizing Congress to legislate on naturalization, Congress’s foreign relations and international commerce authority, and the Federal government’s inherent power as a sovereign to control its borders. 4.4 Legislation, Regulations, &amp; Documents in the Federal Register The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (INA) is the primary statute governing U.S. immigration law. The INA is codified in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, Aliens and Nationality. In addition to Title 8, some other titles of the U.S. Code contain provisions relating to immigration, including Title 20, Employee Benefits, Title 22, Foreign Relations, and Title 29, Labor. Legislation Amending INA: Several public laws have amended the INA since it was first passed in 1952. These laws include the Immigration Reform Control Act of 1986, Immigration Act of 1990, and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, among many others. Immigration Regulations: Title 8, Aliens and Nationality, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)is the main source for immigration regulations. However, several other titles of the CFR, including Title 6, Domestic Security, and Title 22, Foreign Relations, also contain provisions relating to immigration. Immigration Documents in Federal Register: The Federal Register publishes various government documents and notices issued by federal agencies. Documents relating to immigration that can be found in the Federal Register include proposed, final, and interim final regulations, as well as notices of new immigration rules.

In removal proceedings, Immigration Judges decide whether a foreign national must be removed from the United States or if they are entitled to a benefit under U.S. law or a form of relief from deportation. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), part of the EOIR, conducts appeals in certain immigration matters, including appeals from certain immigration court decisions and appeals from some types of decisions made by DHS District Directors. There are three types of BIA decisions: precedent decisions, indexed decisions, and unpublished decisions. Precedent decisions are those that the BIA selects as having a binding effect on DHS employees and immigration courts, and can be found on EOIR’s website. Indexed decisions can be used for guidance in some circumstances and unpublished decisions are generally considered routine. The BIA Practice Manual provides extensive information about the BIA’s operation. The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO), part of USCIS, primarily hears appeals from decisions made by DHS officers on various types of immigration petitions and applications. USCIS publishes online a select number of decisions, called “Adopted AAO Decisions,” which are non-binding precedent decisions that USCIS has adopted as “binding policy guidance for USCIS personnel. The Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO), part of EOIR, hears cases involving certain complaints of unfair immigration-related employment practices and document fraud. The Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA), part of DOL, hears appeals in cases where DOL has denied a labor certification application. The BALCA Judges’ Benchbook (also called the BALCA Deskbook) provides an overview of labor certification law and offers numerous case citations to back -up its explanations of various points of law.

For example, both have databases of immigration case law, titles of the U.S. Code relating to immigration, immigration regulations, immigration administrative decisions (AAO, BIA, OCAHO, and BALCA decisions), and a range of secondary sources covering immigration. AILALink is an online searchable and constantly updated database that is focused exclusively on immigration law and policy. AILALink is maintained by the American Immigration Lawyers Association. A subscription fee is required. 4.8 Organizations The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) is a professional organization for immigration lawyers. It offers members materials and educational resources designed to assist their practices. AILA website posts the text of proposed immigration legislation, enacted immigration legislation, congressional statements and testimony relating to immigration, and so on. Some materials on the website are restricted to members of the Association. The American Immigration Council (AIC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that does litigation, provides public information, and runs a cultural exchange work program. AIC’s website offers a number of documents with background information as well as a blog, Immigration Impact. The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) is one of the best-known NGOs in the United States focusing on immigrants’ rights. NILC does impact litigation and policy analysis and advocacy focusing on immigration law, and other areas of the law that impact low-income immigrants, including labor and employment law and health care. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the rights of and serving the needs of refugees. The U.S. Committee for Refugees website offers various materials—articles, reports, manuals, and more—targeted to lawyers practicing in this subject area. 4.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees(Convention) and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (Protocol) establish the rules under international law for refugees and asylum-seekers. On November 1, 1968, the United States acceded to the Protocol and is bound it. For more information on the Protocol, see the Section I.9 of this guide. Currently, the INA is the primary source of U.S. asylum and refugee law, and the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980 is an amendment to the INA that serves as the main implementing legislation for the Protocol.

Note About Research Guide 1. Introduction This guide is designed to identify key resources concerning the immigration law of Australia, Canada, and the United States. For each country, this guide will identify key government bodies involved in administering immigration law and organizations involved with immigrants and immigration policy. The guide will also identify select legislation, regulations, case law, secondary sources, fee-based databases and research guides relating to each country’s immigration law and policy. It will report whether each country has acceded to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, two key international conventions concerning refugees. The guide will provide online and print resources for each country’s legislation, regulations, and case law relating to immigration, when available. It will also provide links to select resources relating to refugees for each country. Because of the breadth of the subject area, this guide is not comprehensive but selective. It provides an overview of the resources available and aims to serve as a starting point for those interested in conducting in-depth research in this area. Finally, sources marked with an asterisk were consulted in the preparation of this guide. 2. Australian Immigration Law 2.1 Government Bodies The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) administers Australia’s immigration laws. To that end, DIBP determines whether applicants meet the criteria for visas, enforces the immigration laws, and so on. The DIBP website offers, among other things: “Agents Gateway”: Links and information for migration agents Applications and forms Immigration statistics Information booklets Notices of changes to Australian immigration laws Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, who is also an elected member of Parliament, provides direction regarding DIBP’s administration of the immigration laws. The Minister’s website offers, among other things the Press releases and Minister’s profile. Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Australian Human Rights Commission, and Commonwealth Ombudsman: A number of Australian administrative bodies, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal make decisions concerning various immigration matters. The Australian Human Rights Commission and Commonwealth Ombudsman may also issue decisions and reports relating to Australian immigration. To learn more about these administrative bodes, consult the portion of this guide concerning Australian immigration case law. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration, a joint committee of the Australian Parliament, focuses on proposed changes to Australian immigration legislation and regulations. The Committee website offers information about the Committee, as well as the Committee’s inquiries and reports. 2.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: Procedures Advice Manual and Migration Series Instructions: DIBP spells out its procedures and policies in the Procedures Advice Manual (PAM). The current edition of PAM is PAM3. DIAC also issues Migration Series Instructions (MSIs), which comment on specific issues relevant to immigration legislation and regulations. MSIs are eventually incorporated into the PAM. Ministerial Directions: The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the Minister for Immigration to issue directions to a person or body who has powers or functions under the Migration Act 1958. These directions are usually called Ministerial Directions. Currently, there are a number in effect on a variety of subject matters, ranging from circumstances when DIAC should refuse or cancel a visa to the order in which DIAC should process various types of visa applications.

It sets out the law regulating entry and migration to Australia. To that end, it sets out the framework for various types of visas, establishes sanctions for violations of the law, outlines the regulation of migration agents and the judicial review of certain immigration decisions, and so on. The Act was first passed in 1958 but has been amended many times since then. Migration Regulations 1994: The Migration Regulations 1994 are issued pursuant to authority in the Migration Act 1958. These regulations provide details on the immigration law outlined in the Migration Act 1958. For example, the regulations spell out what types of visas are available, how the points system for skilled visa applicants is applied, when visas may be cancelled, and so on. Migration Agents Regulations 1998: The Migration Agents Regulations 1998 are also issued pursuant to authority in the Migration Act 1958. They set out information relating to the regulation of migration agents. For example, these regulations spell out the insurance requirements for migration agents, their continuing professional development obligations, and so on. Australian Citizenship Act 2007: The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 is now the principal legislation governing citizenship. It basically concerns who is a citizen, circumstances causing the loss of citizenship, and so on. Australian Citizenship Regulations 2007: The Australian Citizenship Regulations 2007 largelyinform on procedures relating to obtaining citizenship. Commonwealth of Australia Gazette Notices: The Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations 1994 and other immigration legislation require that certain matters be published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette. For example, the Migration Act 1958 requires that notices be published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette when the annual caps are set for the various classes of visas.

This court was established in 1999 by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999 (Cth) and provides an alternative to the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia and provides relief to the workloads of those courts. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court of Australia (FCA) in a number of areas of general federal law including bankruptcy, human rights, workplace relations and migration matters. Federal Court of Australia: The Federal Court of Australia was established in 1976 by the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and is a superior court of law and equity. The Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) in a number of areas of general federal law including bankruptcy, human rights, workplace relations and migration matters. According to the Federal Court of Australia Annual Report 2014-15: “In 2014–15 twelve migration cases filed in the Court&#39;s appellate jurisdiction related to judgments of single judges of the Court exercising the Court&#39;s original jurisdiction and 665 migration cases related to judgments of the FCC. These 677 cases include 648 appeals, cross appeals and related actions and twenty-nine interlocutory applications.” High Court of Australia: The High Court of Australia was provided for under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) however was established by the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Original jurisdiction in federal matters is provided under section 75 of the Constitution and appellate jurisdiction is provided under s 73 of the Constitution. According to the High Court of Australia Annual Report 2014-15, “The functions of the High Court are to: interpret and apply the law of Australia decide cases of special federal significance, including challenges to the constitutional validity of laws; and hear appeals, by special leave, from federal, state and territory courts.” In the same annual report, it mentions: “The proportion of civil special leave applications involving immigration matters at 32 per cent was consistent with the 28 per cent in 2013-14. Table D illustrates the number of immigration matters as a proportion of civil special leave applications filed in the past 10 years. Eighty-two per cent of the immigration applications filed in 2014-15 were filed by self-represented litigants.” Administrative Decisions Administrative Appeals Tribunal: The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is an administrative body that reviews a variety of decisions made by Australian agencies. The former Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal were amalgamated into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as of 1 July 2016. The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the AAT to review certain DIAC decisions, such as a decision to deny or cancel a visa on character grounds, certain decisions involving criminal deportations, and so on. The AAT also conducts “merits reviews,” like the MRT and RRT. AAT hearings are generally more formal than hearings at MRT and RRT. Minister for Immigration and Border Protection: The Migration Act 1958 authorizes the Minister to replace a decision of the AAT with one more favorable to the applicant if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. A Migration Series Instruction gives some insight into when this discretion may be exercised. The Commonwealth Ombudsman: The Commonwealth Ombudsman responds to complaints of unfair treatment against the Australian Government, including the DIAC. The Ombudsman does not have the authority to overturn DIAC decisions but it can negotiate disputes and recommend that the DIAC change its decisions and practices. Generally, the Ombudsman will review cases only after other avenues of review have been exhausted. When reviewing immigration and detention matters, the Commonwealth Ombudsman may use the title Immigration Ombudsman. The Australian Human Rights Commission: The Australian Human Rights Commission administers complaints of discrimination under these laws: Racial Discrimination Act 1975, Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and Age Discrimination Act 2004. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commission investigates allegations of human rights violations under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986. Like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Human Rights Commission cannot overturn DIAC decisions but it can recommend that the DIAC change its decisions and practices. The Commission website offers news, reports, and information on issues relating to immigration and refugees. AHRC has reported on issues beyond individual cases e.g. The forgotten children: National inquiry into children in immigration detention, 2014.

In addition, the IARC provides immigration advice to low-income individuals and is involved in education on migration issues. The IARC website offers policy materials and information sheets on numerous immigration topics. The Migration Institute of Australia is a professional organization for migration agents. The organization offers continuing education opportunities for agents, as well as legislative advocacy for the profession. The Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) regulates the migration agents industry. The Migration Act 1958 spells out MARA’s powers and responsibilities. The MARA is responsible for maintaining a registry of agents, administering the registration of agents, investigating allegations against migration agents, and disciplining agents who are found to have violated certain rules. The MARA website offers, among other things: Code of Conduct for Registered Migration Agents Migration Agent and Immigration Lawyer Directory MARA discipline decisions Refugee Council of Australia is a non-profit organization that advocates for various refugee communities in Australia and advises and provides support to refugees. 2.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Convention) and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugee (Protocol) are often referred to as the “principal international instruments that provide protection to persons fleeing persecution.”[3] Australia acceded to the Convention on January 22, 1954, and acceded to the Protocol on December 13, 1973. The Migration Act 1958 spells out the “process or manner” in which Australia implements its obligations under the Convention and Protocol.[4] Select Free Online Resources Asylumlaw.org website: Summary of Australian refugee law DIAC website: Forms, information, and publications on Australia’s refugee and humanitarian program DIAC website: Information on support for refugees and other humanitarian entrants In addition, several of the print resources referenced in the Secondary Sources portion of this guide discuss Australian refugee law and procedures. For more information on international refugee law resources, see Elisa Mason’s Guide to International Refugee Law Resources on the Web and Colin Fong’s Researching the Legal Aspects of Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 2.10 Research Guides The following research guides concern Australian immigration law: Immigration &amp; Citizenship Law (posted on Parliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia website). 3. Canadian Immigration Law 3.1 Government Bodies Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada, is the primary Canadian agency responsible for administering Canadian immigration laws. In this capacity, CIC issues visas, makes certain eligibility determinations on refugee claims, runs programs designed to help new immigrants, and so on. The IRCC website offers, among other things: Applications and forms Media Centre Research and statistics materials The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has a broad mandate that includes the protection of Canada’s borders. Among other things, the Canada Border Services Agency plays a role in enforcing Canadian immigration laws by screening immigrants and refugees and investigating possible breaches of Canadian immigration law. Immigration legislation (described below) sets out the division of responsibilities between IRCC and CBSA. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) renders decisions on a variety of immigration matters, including deciding refugee claims made in Canada, hearing appeals of certain IRCC decisions, and conducting admissibility hearings. The Board consists of four divisions: the Refugee Protection Division, the Refugee Appeal Division, the Immigration Division and the Immigration Appeal Division. For further information on the jurisdiction of the IRB, consult the case law portion of this guide, below. 3.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: Operational Manuals: Operational Manuals provide guidance for IRCC employees. They are intended to provide relatively comprehensive information to decision-makers on all areas of IRCC jurisdiction and some matters touching on CBSA responsibilities, particularly those related to immigration enforcement. Topic areas of the manuals include but are not limited to: Citizenship Policy, Enforcement, Temporary Foreign Workers Guidelines, Immigration Legislation, Refugee Protection and Overseas Processing. Note that as of the currency date of this publication, IRCC was in the midst of “modernizing” the format of these manuals, shifting from PDF documents to HTML webpages. Operational Bulletins: IRCC also occasionally issues Operational Bulletins for “one-time-only instructions or to provide urgent instructions to staff for a brief period while the relevant program and policy chapters of the Manuals are being updated.”[5] Select Free Online Resources IRCC website: Operational Manuals IRCC website: Operational Bulletins and Manual Updates 3.3 Constitutional Provisions The Constitution Act, 1867 in § 95 confers concurrent powers in immigration matters to both the Federal and Provincial governments. Specifically, the Constitution says that each Province may make laws relating to immigration into the Province and that the Parliament may make laws relating to immigration into “all or any of the Provinces.” In addition, the Constitution specifies that law of a Province “shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.” The result of the above is that while several provinces maintain their own immigration schemes, primarily aimed at attracting skilled labour and addressing labour shortages, ultimate responsibility for Canada’s immigration scheme resides with the federal government. In addition to the above division of powers contemplated by the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution Act, 1982 brought into existence the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application of the Charter’s protections to immigration legislation and to non-citizens has been the subject of a now significant body of jurisprudence Online Versions of Canadian Constitution Constitution Acts: CanLII version, Department of Justice version Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: CanLII version, Department of Justice version 3.4 Legislation, Regulations &amp; Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is the framework legislation that sets out principles of Canadian immigration and refugee law. The IRPA came into force in 2001, though it has been amended on a number of occasions since that time. The IRPA brought with it several notable changes to Canadian immigration law, such as modifying the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s jurisdiction, incorporating commitments under the Convention Against Torture and increasing the emphasis on criminality, security and inadmissibility. Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), issued pursuant to the IRPA, provide details on that law. For example, the IRPR specify how long a permanent resident card is valid for and what must be done to appeal a removal order. Citizenship Act sets out the law of Canadian citizenship. Specifically, the Citizenship Act establishes the requirements that must be met to qualify for Canadian citizenship, the situations where Canadian citizenship can be lost, the procedures that the CIC must follow when processing citizenship applications, and so on. Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements: The IRPA authorizes the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration to enter into agreements with Provinces and Territories concerning immigration. The Government of Canada has signed comprehensive agreements concerning immigration matters with Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Québec, Saskatchewan and Yukon.[6] One of these agreements, the Canada-Québec Accord, Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens, gives Québec broad autonomy over the selection of immigrants to Québec and integration services for new immigrants. Some of the other immigration agreements between Canada and the Provinces and Territories are called Provincial Nominee agreements. These agreements, among other things, permit the Province or Territory to nominate particular immigrants for permanent residence status to fulfill the Province’s or Territory’s specific labor needs. The CIC website offers information and copies of these agreements.

As noted above, it is responsible for making a range of decisions relating to immigration and refugee matters. The IRB currently consists of four divisions: the Immigration Division, Immigration Appeal Division, Refugee Protection Division, and the Refugee Appeal Division. The Immigration Division conducts certain admissibility hearings and detention reviews. The Immigration Appeal Division conducts appeals on immigration matters, including appeals of rejected sponsorship applications, appeals of certain removal orders, and appeals of certain decisions relating to residency obligations. The Refugee Protection Division adjudicates refugee claims brought by persons in Canada after an officer has made a preliminary determination that the claim is eligible to be heard by the IRB. Finally, the Refugee Appeal Division hears appeals of RPD decisions. Each Division has rules that govern its operations.

Judicial Decisions: While there are various appellate mechanisms built into immigration legislation (most notably the appeals provided by the Immigration Appeal Division and the Refugee Appeal Division), recourse for other immigration decisions occurs by way of an application for leave and judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada. Sections 72-74 of the IRPA sets out the requirements and limitations of judicial review under immigration law. The most significant limitation on judicial review is that it may not be brought as of right, but is subject to the leave of the court: see IRPA s. 72(1). Appeals of Federal Court judicial review decisions (though not decisions on leave) may be brought to the Federal Court of Appeal, but only where the Federal Court justice who has presided over the matter certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question: IRPA s. 74(d).

Brookman, S. Research Guide: Immigration and Refugee Law (posted on Osgoode Hall Law School Library website). 4. United States Immigration Law 4.1 Government Bodies United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a sub-agency in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), administers U.S. immigration benefits. USCIS is responsible for reviewing various types of immigrant and nonimmigrant visa petitions, adjudicating asylum claims, processing applications for citizenship as well as employment authorization, etc. The USCIS website offers, among other things: Information on applying for immigrant visas which grant lawful permanent residence (also commonly known as “Green Cards”) USCIS Press room Homepage for various USCIS application and petition forms U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security In addition to USCIS, two other sub-agencies within DHS are involved in administering and enforcing other aspects of the U.S. immigration system and laws: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP is responsible for policing U.S. borders and returning some recent unauthorized border crossers, and has a role in reviewing some visa applicants’ information and documentation, and CBP agents ultimately decide whom to admit into the United States at ports of entry after reviewing information and documentation provided by those seeking to enter the United States. CBP also reviews petitions and issues nonimmigrant statuses to some nonimmigrant visa applicants, including for Canadian nationals in the TN and L-1 visa classifications. ICE performs immigration-related investigations, enforcement, and removal operations that are primarily conducted from within the interior of the United States, as well as workplace audits and raids to detect unauthorized workers. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) is the primary U.S. agency responsible for conducting foreign affairs. In this capacity, DOS has numerous functions, including processing visas and U.S. passports, as well as administering the J-1 visa Exchange Visitor Program. The DOS website offers a number of resources, including information about the different visas issued by DOS, as well as data on immigrant and nonimmigrant visas issued and processing times: Glossary of visa terms Information about U.S. visas Visa application forms Visa statistics Nonimmigrant Visa Statistics Visa appointment and processing wait times Visa Bulletin (priority dates for immigrant visas) U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Foreign Labor Certification, Employment and Training Administration The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)’s primary roles in the administration of U.S. immigration laws—through the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), an office in DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA)—are to review and certify applications for permanent labor certification for employment-based immigrant visas, and labor certifications and labor condition applications (LCA) for nonimmigrant work visas. For many types of employment-based immigration, U.S. employers must request first that the DOL approve a labor certification request before USCIS may issue an immigrant visa or adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. This process is designed to assure that a U.S. employer’s hiring of a foreign worker for a particular position will not adversely affect U.S. workers. The goal of the labor certification process in the nonimmigrant context for H-2A and H-2B visas is similar, i.e. to protect U.S. workers from negative impacts on their wages and working conditions.The DOL website offers, among other things: Foreign labor certification forms Overview of foreign labor certification rules and processes PERM: Electronic system for filing labor certification applications OFLC Performance Data (contains annual reports and statistics on labor certifications and LCAs) U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division The DOL’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is the U.S. government’s primary labor standards enforcement agency. It is tasked with enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act and a number of other federal statutes related to wages and labor standards, and as its mission statement notes, WHD is also tasked with enforcing “a number of employment standards and worker protections as provided in several immigration related statutes” including the protections for migrant and U.S. workers in the H-2A, H-2B, and H-1B temporary foreign worker programs. WHD’s website offers a number of useful fact sheets that describe the rules and procedures in U.S. work visa programs and provide detailed information about labor standards under U.S. law: WHD fact sheet page Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), an office in the U.S. Department of Justice, adjudicates many types of immigration cases. The EOIR consists of three offices that issue administrative decisions involving immigration: Immigration Courts, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the Office of Chief Administrative Hearing Officer. For more information on the EOIR, consult the portion of this research guide concerning U.S. immigration case law. 4.2 Government Publications The following are some of the publications issued by the government bodies discussed in the previous section: The USCIS Policy Memorandasection online contains documents that “provide[] access to various policy and procedural memoranda which gives guidance to USCIS adjudicators in their work of processing applications and petitions for immigration benefits.” The USCIS Policy Manual “is the agency’s centralized online repository for USCIS’ immigration policies. The USCIS Policy Manual will ultimately replace the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM), the USCIS Immigration Policy Memoranda site, and other policy repositories.” The Adjudicators Field Manual, according to USCIS, “comprehensively details USCIS policies and procedures for adjudicating applications and petitions.” The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) is a multi-volume text that details the DOS’s policies and structure and provides instruction and interpretive guidance on visas and other matters for DOS employees. Volume 9 of the FAM contains material relating to visas. The DOS’s Visa Bulletin reports on the availability of family- and employment-based immigrant visas for permanent residence during the month that the bulletin is published. Immigrant visas are either immediately available or require that the applicant wait until a visa becomes available due to the visa backlog for applicants from certain countries and in certain preference categories (or a combination of both). This information on the Visa Bulletin can provide useful insight into whether visas in a particular category are available and how long applicants will have to wait.

Immigration Law and Procedure. LexisNexis, 1966-. 4.3 Constitutional Provisions The U.S. Constitution does not include a specific provision concerning immigration. The Supreme Court has generally held that Congress has “plenary power”, or wide authority to legislate on immigration. This authority is based on numerous grounds, including the Constitutional provision authorizing Congress to legislate on naturalization, Congress’s foreign relations and international commerce authority, and the Federal government’s inherent power as a sovereign to control its borders. 4.4 Legislation, Regulations, &amp; Documents in the Federal Register The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (INA) is the primary statute governing U.S. immigration law. The INA is codified in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, Aliens and Nationality. In addition to Title 8, some other titles of the U.S. Code contain provisions relating to immigration, including Title 20, Employee Benefits, Title 22, Foreign Relations, and Title 29, Labor. Legislation Amending INA: Several public laws have amended the INA since it was first passed in 1952. These laws include the Immigration Reform Control Act of 1986, Immigration Act of 1990, and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, among many others. Immigration Regulations: Title 8, Aliens and Nationality, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)is the main source for immigration regulations. However, several other titles of the CFR, including Title 6, Domestic Security, and Title 22, Foreign Relations, also contain provisions relating to immigration. Immigration Documents in Federal Register: The Federal Register publishes various government documents and notices issued by federal agencies. Documents relating to immigration that can be found in the Federal Register include proposed, final, and interim final regulations, as well as notices of new immigration rules.

In removal proceedings, Immigration Judges decide whether a foreign national must be removed from the United States or if they are entitled to a benefit under U.S. law or a form of relief from deportation. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), part of the EOIR, conducts appeals in certain immigration matters, including appeals from certain immigration court decisions and appeals from some types of decisions made by DHS District Directors. There are three types of BIA decisions: precedent decisions, indexed decisions, and unpublished decisions. Precedent decisions are those that the BIA selects as having a binding effect on DHS employees and immigration courts, and can be found on EOIR’s website. Indexed decisions can be used for guidance in some circumstances and unpublished decisions are generally considered routine. The BIA Practice Manual provides extensive information about the BIA’s operation. The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO), part of USCIS, primarily hears appeals from decisions made by DHS officers on various types of immigration petitions and applications. USCIS publishes online a select number of decisions, called “Adopted AAO Decisions,” which are non-binding precedent decisions that USCIS has adopted as “binding policy guidance for USCIS personnel. The Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO), part of EOIR, hears cases involving certain complaints of unfair immigration-related employment practices and document fraud. The Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA), part of DOL, hears appeals in cases where DOL has denied a labor certification application. The BALCA Judges’ Benchbook (also called the BALCA Deskbook) provides an overview of labor certification law and offers numerous case citations to back -up its explanations of various points of law.

It offers members materials and educational resources designed to assist their practices. AILA website posts the text of proposed immigration legislation, enacted immigration legislation, congressional statements and testimony relating to immigration, and so on. Some materials on the website are restricted to members of the Association. The American Immigration Council (AIC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that does litigation, provides public information, and runs a cultural exchange work program. AIC’s website offers a number of documents with background information as well as a blog, Immigration Impact. The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) is one of the best-known NGOs in the United States focusing on immigrants’ rights. NILC does impact litigation and policy analysis and advocacy focusing on immigration law, and other areas of the law that impact low-income immigrants, including labor and employment law and health care. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the rights of and serving the needs of refugees. The U.S. Committee for Refugees website offers various materials—articles, reports, manuals, and more—targeted to lawyers practicing in this subject area. 4.9 Refugees and Asylum Seekers The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees(Convention) and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (Protocol) establish the rules under international law for refugees and asylum-seekers. On November 1, 1968, the United States acceded to the Protocol and is bound it. For more information on the Protocol, see the Section I.9 of this guide. Currently, the INA is the primary source of U.S. asylum and refugee law, and the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980 is an amendment to the INA that serves as the main implementing legislation for the Protocol.

Introduction</b></p><p>This guide is designed to identify key resources concerning the immigration law of Australia, Canada, and the United States. For each country, this guide will identify key government bodies involved in administering immigration law and organizations involved with immigrants and immigration policy. The guide will also identify select legislation, regulations, case law, secondary sources, fee-based databases and research guides relating to each country’s immigration law and policy. It will report whether each country has acceded to the United Nations <i>Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees </i>and the United Nations <i>Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees</i>, two key international conventions concerning refugees. The guide will provide online and print resources for each country’s legislation, regulations, and case law relating to immigration, when available. It will also provide links to select resources relating to refugees for each country. Because of the breadth of the subject area, this guide is not comprehensive but selective. It provides an overview of the resources available and aims to serve as a starting point for those interested in conducting in-depth research in this area.

The former Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal were amalgamated into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as of 1 July 2016. The <i>Migration Act 1958</i> authorizes the AAT to review certain DIAC decisions, such as a decision to deny or cancel a visa on character grounds, certain decisions involving criminal deportations, and so on. The AAT also conducts “merits reviews,” like the MRT and RRT. AAT hearings are generally more formal than hearings at MRT and RRT.</p><p><b>Minister for Immigration and Border Protection: </b>The <i>Migration Act 1958</i> authorizes the Minister to replace a decision of the AAT with one more favorable to the applicant if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so.

They are intended to provide relatively comprehensive information to decision-makers on all areas of IRCC jurisdiction and some matters touching on CBSA responsibilities, particularly those related to immigration enforcement. Topic areas of the manuals include but are not limited to: Citizenship Policy, Enforcement, Temporary Foreign Workers Guidelines, Immigration Legislation, Refugee Protection and Overseas Processing. Note that as of the currency date of this publication, IRCC was in the midst of “modernizing” the format of these manuals, shifting from PDF documents to HTML webpages.</p><p><b>Operational Bulletins: </b>IRCC also occasionally issues <i>Operational Bulletins</i> for “one-time-only instructions or to provide urgent instructions to staff for a brief period while the relevant program and policy chapters of the Manuals are being updated.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p><b>Select Free Online Resources </b></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/manuals/index.asp">IRCC website: <i>Operational Manuals</i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/manuals/rss.asp">IRCC website:<i> Operational Bulletins</i> and Manual Updates</a></li></ul><p><a name="CanadaConstitutionalProvisions"><b>3.3 Constitutional Provisions </b></a></p><p>The Constitution Act, 1867 in § 95 confers concurrent powers in immigration matters to both the Federal and Provincial governments. Specifically, the Constitution says that each Province may make laws relating to immigration into the Province and that the Parliament may make laws relating to immigration into “all or any of the Provinces.” In addition, the Constitution specifies that law of a Province “shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.”</p><p>The result of the above is that while several provinces maintain their own immigration schemes, primarily aimed at attracting skilled labour and addressing labour shortages, ultimate responsibility for Canada’s immigration scheme resides with the federal government.</p><p>In addition to the above division of powers contemplated by the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>, the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i> brought into existence the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.

The IRPA came into force in 2001, though it has been amended on a number of occasions since that time. The IRPA brought with it several notable changes to Canadian immigration law, such as modifying the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s jurisdiction, incorporating commitments under the Convention Against Torture and increasing the emphasis on criminality, security and inadmissibility.</p><p><b>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations </b>(IRPR), issued pursuant to the IRPA, provide details on that law. For example, the IRPR specify how long a permanent resident card is valid for and what must be done to appeal a removal order.</p><p><b>Citizenship Act </b>sets out the law of Canadian citizenship. Specifically, the <i>Citizenship Act </i>establishes the requirements that must be met to qualify for Canadian citizenship, the situations where Canadian citizenship can be lost, the procedures that the CIC must follow when processing citizenship applications, and so on.</p><p><b>Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements: </b>The IRPA authorizes the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration to enter into agreements with Provinces and Territories concerning immigration. The Government of Canada has signed comprehensive agreements concerning immigration matters with Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Québec, Saskatchewan and Yukon.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> One of these agreements, the <i>Canada-Québec Accord, Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens</i>, gives Québec broad autonomy over the selection of immigrants to Québec and integration services for new immigrants. Some of the other immigration agreements between Canada and the Provinces and Territories are called Provincial Nominee agreements. These agreements, among other things, permit the Province or Territory to nominate particular immigrants for permanent residence status to fulfill the Province’s or Territory’s specific labor needs. The CIC website offers information and copies of these agreements.</p><p><b>Select Free Online Resources</b></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-29/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-29.html">CanLII website: Citizenship Act</a></li><li><a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/latest/sc-2001-c-27.html">CanLII website: IRPA</a></li><li><a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-2002-227/latest/sor-2002-227.html">CanLII website: IRPR</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/laws-policy/agreements/index.asp">CIC website: Federal-Provincial/Territorial Agreements</a></li><li><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-29/index.html">Department of Justice website: Citizenship Act</a></li><li><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html">Department of Justice website: IRPA </a></li><li><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/index.html">Department of Justice website: IRPR</a></li></ul><p><b>Select Print Resources</b></p><ul><li>Goslett and Caruso. <i>Annotated Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of Canada</i>.

The most significant limitation on judicial review is that it may not be brought as of right, but is subject to the leave of the court: see IRPA s. 72(1).

The goal of the labor certification process in the nonimmigrant context for H-2A and H-2B visas is similar, i.e. to protect U.S. workers from negative impacts on their wages and working conditions.The DOL website offers, among other things:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/form.cfm">Foreign labor certification forms </a></li><li><a href="http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/about.cfm">Overview of foreign labor certification rules and processes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.plc.doleta.gov/eta_start.cfm?actiontype=home&amp;CFID=2233811&amp;CFTOKEN=55840008">PERM: Electronic system for filing labor certification applications</a></li><li><a href="https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm">OFLC Performance Data</a> (contains annual reports and statistics on labor certifications and LCAs)</li></ul><p><b>U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division</b><br /> The DOL’s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/">Wage and Hour Division</a> (WHD) is the U.S. government’s primary labor standards enforcement agency. It is tasked with enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act and a number of other federal statutes related to wages and labor standards, and as its mission statement notes, WHD is also tasked with enforcing “a number of employment standards and worker protections as provided in several immigration related statutes” including the protections for migrant and U.S. workers in the H-2A, H-2B, and H-1B temporary foreign worker programs.
