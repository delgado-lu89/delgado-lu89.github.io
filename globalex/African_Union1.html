Background: The Transformation of the OAU into the AU 1.1. The OAU The Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union, was established by the then independent states of Africa on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[1] The OAU Charter served as a roadmap for the efforts and actions of the independent African States to liberate the continent from colonialism and apartheid. By the end of the 1970s, much of Africa was liberated from colonialism with the exception of the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe. This new reality in Africa led to the call for the review of the OAU Charter as early as 1979. The sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held in Monrovia, Liberia, in July 1979 established the OAU Charter Review Committee (the Committee) in a bid “to re-examine the provisions of the Charter in light of the changes and realities in Africa.”[2] The Committee was meant to make a detailed study of the OAU Charter in light of the current needs of the continent and come up with specific proposals for new norms and institutions that would have been instrumental in responding to the atrocities like the Rwandan genocide. The Committee attempted to forward a proposal for new rules and institutions that would make the Charter more effective.[3] Nevertheless, the activities of the Committee were very slow and highly marginalised because of the absence of active involvement of member States. New developments on the continent and worldwide, such as the total liberation of African States from colonialism, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the challenges of massive human rights violations inside independent African States and intra-state and inter-state conflicts and the end of the cold war made the transformation of the OAU a necessity. 1.2. The Sirte Declaration and the Establishment of the African Union By July 1999, when the OAU Thirty-Fifth Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Algiers, it was clear that the OAU Charter Review Committee had failed to achieve its purpose. The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government accepted a call for an extraordinary meeting on the issue of the transformation of the OAU[4] and decided to hold its 4th extraordinary meeting ‘to discuss ways and means of making the OAU effective so as to keep pace with political and economic developments taking place in the world and the preparation required of Africa within the context of globalization so as to preserve its socio-economic and political potentials.[5] Accordingly, the fourth extraordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Sirte, Libya on 8-9 September 1999 and adopted the Sirte Declaration, which inter alia called for the establishment of the African Union: Article 8: “Having discussed frankly and extensively on how to proceed with the strengthening of the unity of our continent and its peoples, in the light of those proposals, and bearing in mind the current situation on the Continent, we decide to: (i) Establish an African Union, in conformity with the ultimate objectives of the Charter of our Continental Organization and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.”[6] The Sirte Declaration did not specify the details of the new organisation. Rather the Declaration instructed the Council of Ministers and the Secretary-General of the OAU to work on the details of the establishment of the new organisation (African Union) and report their work to the next ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.[7] Accordingly, the OAU Secretary-General established a Departmental Task Force under the Chairmanship of the OAU Assistant-Secretary General for Political Affairs to design the steps that should be taken by the OAU Secretariat to implement the Sirte Declaration.[8] The Departmental Task force recommended involvement of expert consultants to develop the preparatory documents for the Constitutive Act of the African Union in collaboration with the OAU Secretariat.[9] In February 2000, a group of consultants with backgrounds in law, economics and politics met in Addis Ababa and came up with a draft Constitutive Act of the African Union.[10] After consultation by the OAU Secretariat with member states, the draft Constitutive Act together with earlier draft proposals from member states were presented to two consecutive meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians on the establishment of the African Union that were held on 17-20 April 2000 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and 27-29 May 2000 in Tripoli, Libya respectively.[11] The meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and presented their assessment to a Ministerial Conference on the Establishment of the African Union on 31 May - 2 June 2000 in Tripoli, Libya. The Ministerial Conference reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and decided to establish a working group to further elaborate on the draft Constitutive Act.[12] The working group submitted the revised draft Constitutive Act to the Seventy-second ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers on 6-8 July 2000 in Lomé, Togo.[13] After further deliberations, the OAU Council of Ministers approved the draft Constitutive Act and recommended its submission to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government for adoption.[14] The thirty-sixth ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of the Heads of State and Government held in Lomé, Togo on 10-12 July 2000 adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union and urged member states of the OAU to ratify the Constitutive Act as soon as possible.[15] The fifth extraordinary meeting of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government declared the political birth of the African Union and noted that the Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) would enter in to force 30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification by two-thirds of the member States of the OAU, as provided for in Article 28 of the Constitutive Act.[16] The Constitutive Act entered into force on 26 May 2001 upon ratification by two thirds of member States of the OAU replacing the OAU Charter.[17] The African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held its inaugural session in Durban, South Africa, on 9 July 2002.[18] 2. Membership of the African Union There are three requirements for membership in the African Union (AU). First, a State should be an African State.[19] Second, a simple majority of member states supports the application for membership,[20] and third, the African State should sign and ratify the AU Constitutive Act.[21] “After withdrawing in 1984 from the OAU, the predecessor of the AU, Morocco re-joined the AU as its 55th member on 20 January 2017.”[22] Several countries have at various times been suspended from membership of the AU. Suspension is the AU’s usual response to any interruption of constitutional rule by a member.[23] The Assembly also recognises representatives of the African Diaspora,[24] and passed a Resolution inviting its representatives as observers to Assembly sessions.[25] Haiti was granted Observer Status on 2 February 2012 and its request to become an associate member was denied on 17 May 2016. The AU emphasized that according to its statutes only African states can join the African Union.[26] There are no criteria set in the Constitutive Act as standards for the vote on the request for accession. Moreover, all AU member States have the same rights and obligations. The Constitutive Act does not provide for a veto power or any kind of special status for any member State of the AU. Withdrawal of membership is allowed after a member State notifies in writing its intention to renounce its membership of the Union to the Chairperson of the AU Commission, who will communicate such notification to the other State parties of the Constitutive Act.[27] The applicant should wait one year from the date of notification of its intention to renounce membership before its rights and obligations under the Constitutive Act are terminated.[28] The rights and obligations of the Member State remain intact during the one year window period.[29] After a window period of one year, the applicant is deemed to have withdrawn its membership if it does not rescind its decision to renounce its membership. Article 12 of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act provides for the repeal of the right to renounce membership.[30] The explanatory notes accompanying the proposal for the removal of the right recognizes that renunciation of membership is the right of member States but nevertheless argues for the deletion of the right as it has a negative connotation on the unity of the region.[31] 3. The Objectives and Principles of the African Union Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitutive Act of the AU enumerate the objectives and principles of the regional organization. The objectives and principles can be summarized into the following six interrelated areas. The first three sub-sections focus on the objectives while the last three focus on explaining the principles that are meant to be used to achieve the objectives. 3.1. Regional Integration The AU is planned to be a forum for the promotion of regional integration and African unity through socio-economic integration, continental research on all fields including science and technology and the development of common positions on issues of common interest.[32] The AU also establishes institutions that nurture solidarity among African peoples, coordinate its actions with sub-regional economic communities and forges a common front in international negotiations and cooperation.[33] 3.2. Peace and Security The AU member States recognize that ‘the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent.’[34] Thus, one important objective area of the AU is the establishment of collective security system in a bid to promote peace and security as a prerequisite for development on the continent.[35] The focus on peace and security can also be gathered from the new norms and institutions of collective security that member States established.[36] AU member States pledge to strengthen and provide necessary mandate and resources to all relevant institutions including institutions for the maintenance of collective security.[37] 3.3. Protection of Human Rights The protection of human rights is provided as one major objective for the establishment of the AU. One reason given by member States for establishing the AU is their determination ‘to promote and protect human and peoples’ rights, consolidate democratic institutions and culture, and to ensure good governance and the rule of law.’[38] Thus, the AU member States set the observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one objective of the organization.[39] Moreover, the promotion of ‘democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance’ is provided as an objective of the organization within the promotion and protection of the rights of African people. [40] 3.4. Non-Intervention The AU Constitutive Act rules out unilateral intervention between member States. Unilateral intervention among member States is pointed out as a common security threat on the continent.[41] Apart from the direct principle of ‘non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another,’[42] the non-intervention norm is expressed through many principles of the organisation. For instance, the Constitutive Act rejects subversive activities in member States.[43] Subversion is defined as constituting ‘any act that incites, aggravates or creates dissension within or among Member States with the intention or purpose to destabilize or overthrow the existing regime or political order by, among other means, fomenting racial, religious, linguistic, ethnic and other differences’ in violation of the Constitutive Act and the Charter of the United Nations.[44] Thus, subversion does not only include the use or threat of military force, which is prohibited under the Constitutive Act,[45] but also the non-military means of interference.[46] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the AU proposes two additional principles on subversion that request ‘restraint by any Member State from entering into any treaty or alliance that is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the Union’ and prohibit ‘any Member State from allowing the use of its territory as a base for subversion against another Member State.’[47] The AU non-intervention principle is based on the principles of sovereign equality and interdependence among member States and respect of borders existing on achievement of independence.[48] The principles of ‘peaceful co-existence of Member States and their right to live in peace and security’ and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among member States are also the basis of the non-intervention norm among member States of the AU. [49] 3.5. Intervention Intervention in member States under the AU constitutes an unprecedented principle under international law. The AU is endowed with the right to intervene ‘in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.’[50] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union adds ‘a serious threat to legitimate order to restore peace and stability to the Member State of the Union’ as an additional element that would trigger intervention by the AU in a member State as well as crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.[51] AU member States have also agreed on the right to ‘request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and security.’[52] This is a case of intervention by invitation. The request for intervention from a member State is made to the Assembly of the AU, which is the highest decision-making organ.[53] 3.6. Respect for Democracy and Rule of Law AU member States have acknowledged the relation between democracy, rule of law and economic development. The principles of respect for democracy, rule of law, and good governance are adopted as precondition for social justice that ensures economic development in member States of the AU.[54] The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (a.k.a NEPAD) is one framework launched by African States that links the respect for civil and political rights with the right to development in member States of the AU.[55] AU member States adopted the principle of ‘condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of governments.’[56] The rejection of impunity is also a principle adopted by the AU member States that strengthen their commitment to the rule of law.[57] 4. The Institutions of the African Union Article 5 of the AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the following institutions of the Union: the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Specialized Technical Committees, the Pan-African Parliament, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights,[58] the Financial Institutions, the Commission, the Permanent Representatives Committee, and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council.[59] Another key institution, which was not directly established by the Constitutive Act, is the AU Peace and Security Council. A brief exposition based on the Constitutive Act and respective protocols of the institution follows. 4.1. The Assembly The AU Assembly is the supreme decision-making organ of the Union.[60] It is composed of the Heads of State and Government of all member States of the African Union or their accredited representatives.[61] The Assembly meets at least once in a year in an ordinary session and convenes for an extra ordinary meeting at the request of a member State and upon the approval of two-third majority of member States.[62] In its 2004 summit the AU Assembly decided to meet twice a year in ordinary session citing its increasing responsibilities in the face of the many challenges of the continent.[63] All the sessions of the Assembly are to be held at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[64] However, the Assembly can hold its session elsewhere if a member State extends invitation to host the session. The inviting State should not be under sanction from the AU and should be able to meet pre-determined criteria such as paying up all financial obligations to the Union and maintaining favourable political atmosphere.[65] The Assembly should hold at least one session at the headquarters of the Union every other year based on its calendar.[66] As a matter of rule all sessions of the Assembly are closed.[67] However, the Assembly may decide to hold open sessions with a vote of simple majority.[68] The decisions of the Assembly are made either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority of the member States of the Union.[69] The Assembly is led by a Chairperson elected among the heads of State or government for a period of one year.[70] The Chairperson of the Assembly is generally elected after consultations among member States and based on the principle of rotation.[71] However, as an exception to the rule, the head of state or government of a host country which has invited the Assembly for its proceedings is given the automatic right to be the Chairperson of the Assembly.[72] The Chairperson of the Assembly is assisted by the Bureau for each summit composed of fourteen Vice-Chairpersons elected based on geographical distribution and due consultations.[73] The Chairperson is responsible, inter alia, to convene the sessions of the Assembly, guide the proceedings of the Assembly, rule on point of order and in consultation with the Chairperson of the Commission represents the Union in between sessions.[74] As the supreme organ of the Union, the Assembly determines the policies of all organs of the Union.[75] It monitors the implementation of policies and decisions by its organs and takes decisions on reports and recommendations from its organs such as a recommendation for intervention in member States from the Peace and Security Council.[76] In particular the Assembly directs the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and the Commission on management of conflicts, acts of terrorism and emergency situations.[77] The Assembly is mandated to impose sanctions on member States for violation of the principles enshrined in the Constitutive Act.[78] Moreover, the Assembly adopts the budget of the Union and appoints and removes the judges to both the African Human Rights Court and the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, when operational.[79] The structure, functions and regulations of the AU Commission,[80] the administrative wing of the organization, is determined by the Assembly.[81] The Assembly appoints the Chairperson of the Commission and his/her deputies as well as all other Commissioners of the Union and determines their functions and terms of office.[82] The Assembly is also given power of interpretation of the Constitutive Act until the establishment of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.[83] The Assembly has the right to delegate its powers and functions to any organ of the AU.[84] The Assembly delegated its powers to the Peace and Security Council (PSC), the standing decision-making organ for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in 2004.[85] The Assembly recently established the High-Level Committee of Heads of State and Government on the Post-2015 Development Agenda[86] and the High-Level Panel on Alternative Sources of Financing.[87] Another important innovation of the AU is Agenda 2063. Adopted by the Heads of State and Governments of the AU during the 24th Ordinary Assembly held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 30-31 January 2015, Agenda 2063 ‘is a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years’. Its builds on, and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development, such as the Lagos Plan of Action, The Abuja Treaty, The Minimum Integration Programme, the Programme for Infrastructural Development in Africa (PIDA), the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), The New partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), Regional Plans and Programmes and National Plans. It is also built on national, regional, continental best practices in its formulation.[88] 4.2. The Executive Council The Executive Council is another decision-making organ composed of the ministers of foreign affairs or equivalent authorities designated by the governments of the member States of the AU.[89] The Executive Council is directly accountable to the Assembly.[90] The details of most decisions and policies of the Assembly of the Union are worked out by the Council before they are presented to the Assembly for final decision.[91] The Executive Council has the power to make its own binding decisions on common interest of member States such as foreign trade, energy, transport and communication, education, culture, health, and immigration.[92] The Executive Council can also make binding decisions in other areas based on the powers delegated to it by the Assembly.[93] The Executive Council has three Sub-Committees which operate at ministerial level.[94] The Ministerial Committee on Candidatures is responsible for promoting African candidates for positions in international bodies; the Ad-Hoc Ministerial Committee on the Review of Scale of Assessment is responsible for reviewing the scale of assessment for Member State contributions to the AU budget;[95] and the Ministerial Committee on the Challenges of Ratification/Accession and Implementation of the OAU/AU Treaties.[96] The Executive Council meets at least twice a year in ordinary sessions while extraordinary meetings can be held when a member state requires and two-thirds of the member States support the request.[97] In practice, the Executive Council holds its meetings immediately before every session of the AU Assembly. The meeting of the Executive Council is chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or equivalent authority whose country holds the Chair of the Assembly or in case of extraordinary session the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the host member State.[98] As a rule all sessions of the Executive Council are closed unless the Council decides by simple majority to hold open meetings. [99] The Executive Council makes its decisions by consensus or, failing which, by a two-thirds majority of the member States.[100] The Executive Council is assisted by the Permanent Representative Committee[101] and the seven Specialized Technical Committees of the AU. 4.3. The Specialized Technical Committees The Specialized Technical Committees are various committees responsible for, inter alia, the preparation and coordination of the projects and programs of the Union and supervision and follow-up of the policies of the Union or any function assigned by the Executive Council.[102] The Specialized Committees are accountable to the Executive Council.[103] The Committees are composed of ministers or senior officials of member States responsible for rural economy and agriculture; monetary and financial affairs; trade, customs and immigration matters; industry, science and technology, energy, natural resources and environment; transport, communications and tourism; Health, Labour and Social Affairs; and Education, Culture and Human Resources.[104] The Assembly has the mandate to add other relevant committees or reorganize the existing Specialized Committees as it deems fit.[105] The Specialized Technical Committees meet as often as required by their tasks or as directed by the Executive Council.[106] 4.4. The Permanent Representatives Committee The Permanent Representative Committee (PRC) is a body composed of permanent representatives of member States to the AU resident at the Headquarters of the Union in Addis Ababa or other duly accredited plenipotentiaries of member States.[107] The PRC is accountable to the Executive Council.[108] The PRC serves as an advisory body to Executive Council.[109] The PRC prepares the bulk of the work of the Executive Council, carrying out most of the practical activities for the Executive Council including the preparation and recommendation of agendas for the sessions of the Executive Council and drafting proposals for decisions of the Executive Council.[110] The PRC monitors the implementation of the budget of the Union and the decisions of the Executive Council.[111] The Executive Council can assign more functions to the PRC.[112] The PRC can establish ad-hoc committees and working groups to carry out its tasks. The PRC has eleven (11) sub-Committees on: Administrative, Budgetary and Financial Matters; Audit Matters; Contributions; Economic and Trade Matters; Headquarters and Host Agreements; Multilateral Cooperation and Strategic Partnerships; New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); Programmes and Conferences; Refugees; Structures; and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine Relief in Africa,[113] and Rules, Standards and Credentials.[114] The PRC is also the organ that facilitates the communication between the Commission of the AU and member States.[115] The PRC holds its sessions at the headquarters of the AU at least once in a month chaired by the Permanent Representative whose country holds the chair of the Executive Council.[116] All the sessions of the PRC are closed unless the PRC decides by simple majority to hold open meetings.[117] 4.5. The Peace and Security Council The Peace and Security Council with its supporting institutions is the main pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture (ASPA). The ASPA is the umbrella term for the key AU mechanisms for promoting peace, security and stability in the African continent.[118] 4.5.1. Establishment The Protocol on the Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union[119] established the Peace and Security Council as one the organs of the AU in accordance with article 5 (2) of the Constitutive Act.[120] In the initial process of establishing the AU, the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was incorporated and retained as a peace and security organ of the AU based on Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act.[121] Following the incorporation of the Central Organ, the OAU Assembly requested the OAU Secretary-General to undertake a review of the structures, procedures and working methods of the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism, including the possibility of changing its name.[122] The OAU Secretary-General presented his report and the draft protocol for the establishment of a new Peace and Security Council to the OAU Council of Ministers in July 2002 during the transition from OAU to the AU.[123] The draft protocol was presented to the first ordinary session of the Assembly of African Union held in Durban, South Africa. The Protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council was adopted by the first ordinary session of the AU Assembly and entered into force on 26 December 2003.[124] The Peace and Security Council is a permanent decision-making organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa established on the basis of Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act of the AU.[125] The Peace and Security Council is situated at the Headquarters of the African Union.[126] 4.5.2. Composition The 15 member States of the Peace and Security Council are elected by the AU Executive Council and endorsed by the AU Assembly. The election is based on the principles of equitable regional representation and national rotation, with three members from the centre, three members from the east, two members from the north, three members from the south and four members from the west of Africa.[127] There is no provision for permanent and non-permanent members of the Peace and Security Council.[128] However, the Peace and Security Council Protocol has provided detailed criteria for membership of States to the Council. The Peace and Security Council Protocol requires that prospective member States to the Peace and Security Council should exhibit, inter alia, respect for constitutional governance, the rule of law, the protection of human rights and the commitment to honour financial obligations of the Union.[129] Any AU member State that meets the criteria may apply for membership to the Peace and Security Council.[130] Initial election on the candidacy is preferably done by each sub-region of Africa which would later submit the candidates to the AU Assembly, the organ which makes the final selection.[131] The first members of the Peace and Security Council were elected by the Executive Council as delegated by the Assembly.[132] The Peace and Security Council Protocol also provides that the Assembly shall conduct a periodic review to assess the extent to which elected members of the Council continue to meet the membership criteria and ‘take action as appropriate’.[133] The phrase ‘take action as appropriate’ refers to the possibility of dismissal of a member State from the Peace and Security Council when it fails to fulfil the criteria of membership specified under Article 5(2) of the Peace and Security Council Protocol. 4.5.3. Subsidiary Bodies The PSC established two subsidiary bodies: the Committee of Experts and the Military Staff Committee, as authorized by its Protocol. The following proposed committees of the PSC: the Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD); Sanctions, Counter-Terrorism, Resource Mobilization; and Procedures and Mechanisms for Peace Support Operations are not yet operational. The Committee of Experts: The Committee of Experts was established to assist PSC prepare its draft decisions.[134] The Committee comprises of a designated expert representing each PSC Member State and the Peace and Security Department expert officers. The Committee meets before each PSC meeting. The Military Staff Committee: The Military Staff Committee (MSC) is a standing advisory body to the Peace and Security Council on military and related security matters.[135] The MSC is composed of Senior Military Officers of members of the Peace and Security Council.[136] However, the MSC can also meet at the level of Chiefs of Defence Staff of members of the Peace and Security Council.[137] The MSC members meet as often as required, and at least once in a month.[138] Even though the MSC is directly accountable to the Peace and Security Council, it can also consult with other relevant organs of the AU.[139] The meetings of the MSC follow the Rules of Procedure provided under the Policy Framework for the establishment of the ASF and MSC[140] and where applicable the rules of procedure of the Peace and Security Council.[141] 4.5.4. Supporting Institutions In implementing its mandate, the Peace and Security Council works with the various AU organs including the Assembly, Pan-African Parliament and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[142] The following organs were initially designated as supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council: the AU Commission, the Peace Fund, the Continental Early Warning System, the Panel of the Wise, the African Standby Force, and the Military Staff Committee.[143] Additional supporting institutions include the Friends of the Panel of the Wise, the Pan-African Network of the Wise (PanWise), the Committee of Experts, and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. A brief overview of each supporting institution follows. The AU Commission: The Peace and Security directorate is the main organ of the AU Commission responsible for providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council.[144] The Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission provides the Council with a permanent Secretariat to run its day to day activities.[145] Moreover, the Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission establishes and operationalise all the supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council namely the Continental Early Warning System, the African Standby Force and the Peace Fund and the Panel of the Wise.[146] Moreover, the Chairperson of the AU Commission has the responsibility to monitor the implementation of decisions adopted by the Peace and Security Council upon the approval of the Assembly.[147] In a bid to strengthen it, the Assembly plans to transform the African Union Commission into the African Union Authority.[148] The Peace Fund: The Peace and Security Council Protocol provides for the establishment of a Special Fund, known as the Peace Fund, in order to finance the activities of the AU aimed at maintaining peace and security in the continent.[149] In July 2016, the Assembly adopted the High Representative for the Fund recommendations to inter alia, have three thematic windows, Mediation and Preventive Diplomacy, Institutional Capacity and Peace Operations as well as clear governance structures and independent fund management. [150] The primary source of the Peace Fund is the regular budget to the African Union, known as the General Peace Fund.[151] The other major category of the Peace Fund is what is called the Special Contribution.[152] Under the Special Contribution, the sources of the Peace fund are voluntary contributions from AU member States, voluntary contributions from the private sector and civil society as well as individuals in AU member States and donations from non-member States.[153] Donations and voluntary contributions from sources outside of Africa are accepted in so far as they are ‘in conformity with the objectives and principles of the Union’. [154] The PSC Protocol also provides for a revolving trust fund within the broader Peace Fund, to provide a standing reserve for specific projects in case of emergencies and unforeseen priorities.[155] The level of funding required in the Trust Fund is to be determined by the relevant AU policy organs on recommendation by the PSC. The Continental Early Warning System: The Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) is a supporting institution designed to carry out the prevention and early warning mandate of the Peace and Security Council.[156] The CEWS is managed by the Conflict Prevention and Early Warning Unit of the Department of Peace and Security. It consists of two important bodies: the main observation and monitoring centre under the Peace and Security directorate located at the headquarters of the AU (called ‘The Situation Room’); and a communication panel with the observation and monitoring rooms in each of the sub-regional organizations.[157] The Situation Room collects and analyses information from ‘the public domain in hard and soft prints, including newspapers both private and public, satellite TV channels, electronic news sites, and from informal sources on the ground.’[158] The information is then processed and compiled in the form of ‘News Briefs’, and is forwarded to the relevant organs of the AU three times a day and should be posted and circulated through the intranet for all staff of the organization.[159] The Situation Room is linked directly with the observation and monitoring units of the Regional Mechanisms that collect and process data at their level and transmit the same to the Situation Room.[160] The Situation Room also benefits from its collaboration with the United Nations agencies and other international organizations, academic institutions and NGOs.[161] The observation and monitoring is based on an early warning module which contains political, economic, social, military and humanitarian indicators.[162] The CEWS holds periodic and on-demand meetings with the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) on matters of mutual concern. The Panel of the Wise: The Panel of the Wise is an advisory body composed of five highly respected African personalities who have made outstanding contribution to the cause of peace and security on the continent.[163] The Panel was created in 2002, and became operational in 2008. Members of the Panel are appointed by the Assembly for a term of three years. The Panel of the Wise advises the Peace and Security Council and the AU Commission on conflict prevention and promotion of stability in Africa.[164] A body similar to the Panel of the Wise, the OAU’s Commission of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration was established on 21 July 1964, as a tool to support peaceful settlement of disputes between OAU Member States.[165] It was however, non-operational and was replaced in 1993 by the broader Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. No panel was set up under the Mechanism. The Friends of the Panel of the Wise: The Friends of the Panel of the Wise, a team of eminent African personalities from the AU’s five regions, was established in 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of the Panel of the Wise.[166] The Friends of the Panel of the Wise are appointed by the Chairperson of the AU Commission and endorsed by the Assembly. Comprised of outgoing members of the Panel of the Wise, the members are expected to attend all Panel meetings and share the same privileges and entitlements as Panel members. The Pan-African Network of the Wise (PanWise): PanWise was conceived at the June 2012 Ouagadougou Retreat of the Panel of the Wise with regional counterparts.[167] In May 2013, the AU Assembly endorsed the establishment of PanWise in order to bring the Panel of the Wise together with similar regional mechanisms, in a bid to strengthen, coordinate and harmonize the prevention of conflicts and peace keeping efforts under a single umbrella. The core members of PanWise are the AU Panel of the Wise/Friends and their existing and future sub-regional counterparts. They include the Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS’s) Council of the Wise, the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC’s) Mediation Reference Group and Panel of Elders, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa’s (COMESA’s) Committee of Elders; and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development’s (IGAD’s) Mediation Contact Group, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), East African Community (EAC), Arab Maghreb Union (UMA), and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States (CEN–SAD). The associate members of PanWise include the Forum of Former African Heads of State, the Association of African Ombudsmen and Mediators (AAOM), National infrastructures for peace, National mediation councils, and All Africa Council of Churches. The African Standby Force: A key enforcement and supporting institution under the Peace and Security Council is the African Standby Force. The Peace and Security Protocol provides for the establishment of the African Standby Force, composed of a standby arrangement of multi-national and multi-disciplinary civilian, police and military personnel, for the purpose of implementing the peacekeeping and intervention mandate of the AU.[168] Five regional groupings: Central African Standby Force (CASF), Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF), North African Regional Capability (NARC), Southern Africa Standby Force (SASF), and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Standby Force, were envisaged to be fully operational by December 2015.[169] The AU Assembly declared the African Standby Force (ASF) operationally ready in January 2016,[170] but it has not been deployed in its originally designed form. The Peace Support Operations Division, formerly known as the Continental Planning Element of the African Standby Force, was set up to plan, launch, sustain and liquidate peace support operations as authorized by the African Union (AU).[171] The Division also assists in directing and managing such operations. The AU has been involved in several Peace Support Operations (PSOs), either alone or jointly with the United Nations since 2003.[172] African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC): The African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) was established in principle, on an interim basis by the AU Assembly at its May 2013 Summit. ACIRC was established to address the Africa’s rapid response deficit and until ASF and its rapid deployment capability becomes fully operational.[173] The purpose of the ACIRC is to provide the AU with a flexible and robust force, made up of military, police and civilian personnel, and equipment and resources voluntarily provided by willing and capable Member States, to be deployed very rapidly to effectively respond to emergency situations, within the framework of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA).[174] In January 2014, the AU Assembly at its 22nd ordinary session decided to operationalize ACIRC as a transitional arrangement.[175] Twelve Member States volunteered to be the initial participating countries.[176] The volunteering nations have so far conducted three command-post military exercises: November 2014 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, August 2016 in Paradise Valley, Bengo province, Angola and March 2017 at Rwanda Military Academy-Gako, as part of the preparation for readiness of the pledged capabilities. The following proposed committees of the PSC are not yet fully operational: Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD); Sanctions, Counter-Terrorism, Resource Mobilisation; and Procedures and Mechanisms for Peace Support Operations. 4.6. The Pan-African Parliament The AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament (PAP) whose functions, composition and powers are provided for under a separate protocol, the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community Relating to the Pan-African Parliament.[177] The 2001 Protocol is to be replaced upon entry into force of the Protocol to the Constitutive Act of the African Union Relating to the Pan-African Parliament.[178] Adopted by the AU Assembly in 2014, the new Protocol comes into force 30 days after the deposit of instruments of ratification by a simple majority of AU Member States. As at September 2016, 13 Member States have signed the Protocol and 5 have ratified it. The Protocol for the establishment of the PAP provides that Parliamentarians be elected from the Parliament or equivalent legislative organs of each member state.[179] Each Member State of the AU has five Parliamentarians in the PAP selected from both ruling and opposition parties participating in the national parliaments of member States and at least one of whom must be a woman.[180] The tenure of the Parliamentarians in the PAP runs concurrently with their tenure at their national parliament.[181] However, the parliamentarians act and vote independently of their national parliament once they are sworn in the PAP.[182] In its daily activities the PAP is run by a Bureau composed of a president and four vice-presidents elected from all sub-regions based on equitable geographical representation and supported by a Clerk and deputy Clerks .[183] The idea behind the establishment of the PAP is the representation of the African people and their grass-root organizations in the deliberations and decisions of the policy organs of the AU.[184] The PAP is given the mandate to ‘exercise advisory and consultative powers only’ to the Assembly and to all policy organs of the Union either at the request of the AU organs or at its own initiative.[185] In order to carry out its mandate, the PAP is given, inter alia, the power to discuss and make recommendations and pass resolutions on issues of importance and relevance to the continent such as the promotion of peace and security and protection of human rights and democracy.[186] The PAP is also given the mandate to issue invitations to the representatives of policy organs of the Union and member States “to furnish explanations in plenary on issues affecting or likely to affect the life of the African Union.”[187] The members of the PAP are entitled to forward their questions to any policy organ of the AU through the President of the PAP while the President of the PAP can in consultation with the Bureau, invite the Chairperson of the Assembly to explain a decision taken by the Assembly to the PAP.[188] The AU Commission is obliged to submit annual report on the activities of the Union to the PAP.[189] The permanent committees meet at least twice a year in ordinary sessions,[190] while a request for extraordinary session by two-thirds of the PAP members, the Assembly or the Executive Council of the Union can be made at any time.[191] All sessions of the PAP are open for the public unless there is the PAP Bureau decides otherwise.[192] The President of the PAP attends AU Assembly sessions and presents the reports of the PAP to the Assembly.[193] The PAP is operational and sits in South Africa.[194] The PAP budget, including the allowances for its members, is part of the overall AU budget.[195] 4.7. The Court of Justice The Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the Court of Justice of the Union whose statute, composition, and functions are defined in a separate protocol.[196] Identified as the ‘principal judicial organ of the Union’, its statute, composition, and functions were defined in a separate protocol. [197] Although, the Protocol of the Court entered into force in February 2009, 30 days after 15 Member States had ratified it, the Court never became operational. As at 15 June 2017, 44 Member States have signed the 2003 Protocol and 18 have ratified it; the latest ratification on 19 December 2016. In 2008, the AU Assembly merged the Court with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights into a single court, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights. 4.8. The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights (the Court) was not established by the AU Constitutive Act.[198] The initiative for the establishment of the Court started officially with a resolution adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, in June 1994. The Secretary-General was requested to convene a Government legal experts` meeting to deliberate, in conjunction with the African Commission, on how to enhance the efficiency of the African Commission and to consider in particular the establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples Rights.[199] A draft document on an African human rights court was produced by a meeting of experts organized by the OAU Secretariat in collaboration with the African C omission and the International Commission of Jurists, in September 1995.[200] The draft document formed the basis of the first official draft protocol, the Cape Town Draft which was produced a few days later by an OAU meeting of government legal experts.[201] After further elaboration and refining, the Draft Protocol was adopted by the conference of OAU Ministers of Justice/Attorneys General in December 1997.[202] The OAU Council of Ministers adopted the Draft Protocol in February1998, and in June 1998, the 34th ordinary session of the General Assembly adopted and opened the Protocol for signature. The Court was established by the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, (the Protocol).[203] The Court was established to ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights in Africa.[204] The Court complements and reinforces the functions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights.[205] The Court has jurisdiction over all cases and disputes submitted to it concerning the interpretation and application of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, this Protocol and any other relevant human rights instrument ratified by the States concerned.[206] The Court receives complaints and/or applications submitted to it either by the African Commission of Human and Peoples’ Rights or State parties to the Protocol or African Intergovernmental Organizations.[207] Non-Governmental Organizations with observer status before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and individuals can also institute cases directly before the Court, if the State Party involved has made a Declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the Court.[208] As at March 2014, only seven countries have made such a Declaration. The Court is composed of eleven judges who are nationals of Member States of the African Union.[209] The Judges of the Court are elected, after nomination by their respective States, in their individual capacities from among African jurists of proven integrity and of recognized practical, judicial or academic competence and experience in the field of human rights.[210] The judges are elected for a six year or four year term, renewable once.[211] The President and Vice-President of the Court are elected by the judges from among themselves, and serve a two year term. They can be re-elected only once.[212] All the judges, except the President of the Court, work on a part-time basis.[213] The Court officially started its operations in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in November 2006, but in August 2007 it moved to its seat in Arusha, the United Republic of Tanzania. Initially, ‘the Court dealt principally with operational and administrative issues, including the development of the structure of the Court&#39;s Registry, preparation of its budget and drafting of its Interim Rules of Procedure’.[214] The judges adopted the Interim Rules of the Court in 2008. The final Rules of Court was adopted in June 2010, after consultation with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, in order to harmonize the rules of both institutions.[215] The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights remains provisionally in force until the entry into force of the 2008 Protocol and the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights; that is, after 15 Member States have ratified the 2008 Protocol. As at 15 June 2017, 30 states have signed the 2008 Protocol and only 6 have ratified it. 4.9. The African Court of Justice and Human Rights In July 2004, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government decided that the Court of Justice ‘should be integrated into one Court’ with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights citing financial and logistical constraints to establish two different courts.[216] In July 2008, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government adopted the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, merging the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the Court of Justice of the African Union into a single Court, named the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.[217] The Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (Single Protocol) adopted July 2008) is to replace the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights (the old Protocol), and the Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union.[218] The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights is still in operation in spite of its merger with the Court of Justice,[219] because the Protocol and the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights is not yet in force. As at 8 February 2018 only six (6) of the mandatory fifteen (15) Member States have deposited their instruments of ratification. However, according to Justice Sylvain Sore, president of the African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, its mandate will not be usurped by the proposed Single court. The Court will remain separate, obligated to its mandate but as a chamber of the new Court.[220] 4.10. Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) In August 2012, the African Union and Senegal established the Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) within the Senegalese judicial system to “prosecute and try the person(s) most responsible for crimes and serious violations of international law, customary international law and international conventions ratified by Chad, committed on the territory of Chad during the period from 7 June 1982 to 1 December 1990.”[221] The Chambers’ jurisdiction covers genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture,[222] setting a precedent as an internationalized criminal tribunal operating exclusively on the basis of universal jurisdiction. The Court comprises the Investigative/Pre-Trial Chamber, Indictment Chamber, Trial Chamber and Appeals Chamber.[223] Article 11 of the EAC Statute provides that the Chambers shall be composed of two Senegalese judges and two alternate Senegalese judges, and an AU Member State non-Senegalese president, nominated by the Senegalese Minister of Justice and appointed by the Chairperson of the AU Commission. The Extraordinary African Chambers shall be dissolved in their own right once all judgments are final.[224] Inaugurated in February 2013 in Dakar, Senegal, the Chambers convicted Hissène Habré, former President of Chad (1982–90) of crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture, and sentenced him to life imprisonment on 30 May 2016. On April 27, 2017, an appeals court confirmed the verdict. 4.11. The Commission The AU Commission is a permanent organ established by the AU Constitutive Act.[225] The Commission is the administrative wing of the AU accountable to the Assembly and the Executive Council.[226] The AU Commission is given numerous administrative functions and mandate that include administrating the AU institutions; coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU such as Assembly , the Executive Council , the Peace and Security Council of the Union in collaboration with the organs; providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council; initiating proposals on the budget and wide range of regional issues; organizing and managing meetings and accepting donations and grants that are compatible with the objectives and principles of the Union; and depositing the treaties adopted and ratified under the aegis of the African Union.[227] The AU Commission is composed of the Chairperson, the deputy Chairperson and eight Commissioners all of whom are appointed by the Assembly based on gender balance and equitable representation of all sub-regions.[228] Once appointed, all officials of the AU Commission are only responsible to the AU and not to any government and external authority.[229] The officials are assisted by all necessary staff in running the Commission located at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[230] The Chairperson of the Commission is the Chief Executive Officer and legal representative of the AU and is mandated to carry out many essential functions such as the overall responsibility of the finances and administration of the Commission, the preparation of its budget, participating in the meetings of the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and keep records of the deliberations, follow up and report on the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU, appoint staff of the Commission and carry out any function that is assigned to him by the Assembly and the Executive Council.[231] The Chairperson is accountable to the Executive Council.[232] The Deputy Chairperson is accountable to the Chairperson and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Organization.[233] The eight Commissioners are accountable to the Chairperson of the Commission and each Commissioner heads one of the eight departments/directorates of the Commission established along the eight portfolios of the Commission.[234] The portfolios of the Commission are Political Affairs; Peace and Security; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; and Economic Affairs.[235] The Third ordinary session of the Executive Council of the AU maintained the portfolios as departments of the Commission.[236] The Department of Social Affairs oversees two specialized offices: the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN) and the Centre for Linguistic and Historical Studies by Oral Tradition (CELHTO). The Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture oversees the five specialized technical offices: Coordinating Office for the Development Project of the Fouta Djallon Region;[237] African Union-Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR); African Union-Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC); African Union-Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (AU-PATTEC); and the Semi-Arid Food Grain Research and Development (SAFGRAD). It also works with the African Union-Inter-African Phyto-sanitary Council (AU-IAPSC). The Commissioner for Human Resources, Science and Technology oversees the Scientific, Technical and Research Commission (STRC).[238] The Department of Peace and Security is the liaison point for the work of the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism.[239] The Commission consists of directorates and organizational units under the offices of the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission. The Bureau of the Chairperson, the Directorate for Women, Gender and Development; the Directorate for Strategic Policy Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, International Cooperation and Resource Mobilization; the Communication and Information Unit; and Protocol Services Unit; the NEPAD Coordination Unit; the Secretariat of the CSSDCA; the Office of the Legal Counsel; the Office of the Internal Auditor; the Office of the Secretary-General to the Commission; Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO); and the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) are under the office of the Chairperson.[240] The Directorate for Administration and Human Resources Development; the Directorate for Programming, Budgeting, Finance and Accounting; the Medical Services Directorate; and the Directorate for Conference Services are under the Office of the Deputy Chairperson.[241] The self-funding Technical Committee of Experts for the Implementation of the Diaspora Legacy Projects was established in 2013 by the Assembly. The Committee is composed of the heads or representatives of the following institutions and sectors: AU Commission; New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA); African Development Bank (AfDB); United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); Regional Economic Communities (RECs); Africa Capacity Building Institute; the private sector; African Diaspora; and implementing agencies.[242] The Technical Committee of Experts is to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the Five Legacy Projects that were adopted at the Global African Diaspora Summit in May 2012, and endorsed by the Assembly in July 2012.[243] 4.12. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council The AU Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) is an advisory body composed of representatives of civil society, professional groups and cultural groups both in Africa and in the Diaspora.[244] The main idea behind the establishment of the ECOSOCC is the broad participation of the ordinary African citizens through representative civil society organizations and professional groups in the activities of the Union.[245] Thus, the main objectives of the ECOSOCC include the participation of the African Civil Society in the promulgation and implementation of the policies and norms of the AU and the development of communication between the ordinary citizens of Africa on common issues of the continent.[246] Based on its objectives, the ECOSOCC is given the task of popularization of the AU norms among the citizens of Africa and giving advisory services to the organs of the Union how best to implement the norms and policies of the Organization at its own initiative or at the request of organs of the Union.[247] The structures of the ECOSOCC include its General Assembly; an 18 member Standing Committee; 10 Sectoral Cluster Committees; and Credentials Committee.[248] The General Assembly is the highest decision making organ[249] with 150 civil society organizations (CSOs) at the level of member states, sub-regions, the continent, the African diaspora and ex-officio members appointed by the Commission.[250] The election of member states, regional, continental and Diaspora representatives is based on 50 percent gender equality and 50 percent aged between 18 and 35. Members are elected for four-year terms and may be re-elected once.[251] The Standing Committee appointed by the General Assembly coordinates the work of ECOSOCC, while the Sectoral Cluster Committees advise on the following areas: Peace and Security; Political Affairs; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs and Health; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; Economic Affairs; Women and Gender; and Cross-Cutting Programmes (such as HIV/AIDS, international cooperation and coordination with other AU institutions and organs).[252] The Credentials Committee is responsible for examining the credentials of ECOSOCC members and their representatives.[253] The Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) office in the AU Commission acts as the Secretariat for ECOSOCC, pending arrangements for the relocation of the Secretariat to Zambia.[254] The AU ECOSOCC was launched on March 27-30, 2005 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at the headquarters of the AU.[255] During the launching conference, the Interim General Assembly of the ECOSOCC swore in the late Wangari Maathai, Nobel Laureate from Kenya, as the President of the Bureau of the Interim General Assembly of ECOSOCC with four deputies from the centre, north, south and west sub-regions.[256] The mandate of the first ECOSOCC General Assembly session launched on, 9 September 2008, expired in September 2012. The second permanent General Assembly of ECOSOCC was inaugurated on 22 December 2014 in Nairobi, Kenya.[257] Its mandate ends in December 2018.[258] In January 2016, the Assembly adopted ECOSOCC’s Rules of Procedure.[259] 4.13. The Financial Institutions The Constitutive Act of the AU envisaged the establishment of the African Central Bank, the African Monetary Fund and the African Investment Bank as the three new financial institutions under the Union.[260] The rules and regulations for the establishment of the African Central Bank are yet to be provided in a separate protocol. The fourth ordinary session of the AU Assembly requested the Chairperson of the Commission to prepare the legal instruments for the establishment of the three financial institutions.[261] The Assembly session also decided that the African Central Bank should be located in the Western sub-region while the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund should be located in the Northern and Central sub-regions respectively.[262] Accordingly Nigeria was selected as the host country for the future African Central Bank while Libya and Cameroon were chosen to host the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund respectively.[263] A flagship programme of the AUC Agenda 2063, the African Central Bank is a joint project in collaboration with the Bureau of the African Central Bank Association (AACB). The implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Strategy on the establishment of the African Central Bank is expected to start in 2018.[264] 4.13.1. The African Monetary Fund On 27 June 2014, the AU Assembly at its 23rd ordinary session adopted the Protocol and the Statute for the establishment of the African Monetary Fund (AMF); with an initial capital of 22.64 billion dollars.[265] The Protocol and the Statute shall enter into force on ratification by 15 of the 54 of the Member States of the African Union and the payment of at least 25 per cent of the minimum paid-up capital.[266] As at 8 February 2018, 10 Member States have signed the Protocol but none has ratified it. The purpose of the Fund is to foster macroeconomic stability, sustainable shared economic growth and balanced development in the continent, in order to facilitate the effective and predictable integration of African economies.[267] The objectives of the African Monetary Fund are to provide financial assistance to AU Member States; act as a clearing house as well as undertake macro-economic purveyance within the continent; co-ordinate the monetary policies of Member States and promote cooperation between the monetary authorities in these states; and encourage capital movements between member states.[268] The functions and activities of the Fund include promoting and facilitating trade, the settlement of commercial payment and encouraging capital flow between State Parties; providing short-term and medium-term credit facilities to sustain balance of payment and providing technical assistance and policy advice, to States Parties; with a view to assisting in financing their overall balance of payments deficits.[269] The agreed timeframe under Agenda 2063 for establishing the AMF is 2023.[270] The Headquarters of the African Monetary Fund is to be in Yaoundé, Republic of Cameroon.[271] 4.13.2. The African Investment Bank On 4th February 2009, the AU Assembly at its 12th ordinary session adopted the Protocol on the African Investment Bank and the Statute annexed to it.[272] The Annexes to the Statutes of the African Investment Bank were adopted on 2nd February 2010 at the 14th ordinary session of the Assembly.[273] The Protocol shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the Protocol.[274] As at 15 June 2017, 22 member states have signed the Protocol and 5 have ratified it. The Statute of the African Investment Bank shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification.[275] The agreed timeframe under Agenda 2063 for establishing the AIB was 2016, but as at 15 June 2017, 22 Member States have signed the Protocol and only 5 have ratified it. The purpose of the Bank is to foster economic integration and development in line with the objectives of the Union.[276] The objectives of the Bank are to promote investment activities of the public and private sector intended to advance regional integration of the Member States of the African Union; utilize available resources for the implementation of investment projects contributing to strengthening the private sector and modernization of rural sector activities and infrastructures; mobilize resources from capital markets inside and outside Africa for the financing of investment projects in African countries; and provide technical assistance as may be needed in African countries for the study, preparation, financing and execution of investment projects.[277] The Headquarters of the Bank will be in Tripoli, Libya.[278] 4.14. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights forms part of the African regional system of human rights, which has its basis on the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[279] The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights established the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as an organ of implementation of its substantive provisions.[280] The AU Constitutive Act does not recognize the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one of the organs of the AU. However, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights was incorporated as an organ of the AU in 2002.[281] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is composed of eleven members elected by the AU Executive Committee from member States and appointed by the AU Assembly.[282] The members of the Commission serve in their personal capacity.[283] The Commission is run by a Secretariat in its daily activities.[284] The budget of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is provided by the AU as part of the overall budget of the AU Commission.[285] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given three mandates: promotional, protective and interpretative.[286] Under the promotional mandate, the Commission works for the awareness of human rights in Africa through different methods such as publication, research on human rights problems in Africa and collaboration with African and other international institutions concerned with the protection of human and peoples’ rights.[287] The protective mandate of the Commission generally provides that the Commission shall ‘ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter.’[288] Under the protective mandate, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights examine State reports, inter-state communications, and in limited cases, individual complaints of human rights violations. [289] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given the general power to ‘resort to any appropriate method of investigation’ thereby giving it some latitude to adopt investigation methods within the bounds of its protective mandate.[290] Consequently, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has developed other important protective functions over the years. The use of fact-finding missions in member States and the appointment of Special Rapporteur on thematic issues of human rights on the continent are the two main protective functions undertaken by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[291] All the above-mentioned protective measures of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights result in reports and recommendations which are communicated to the concerned State parties and to the Assembly of the AU.[292] The AU Assembly may request the Commission to make further in-depth investigation if it believes that the report of the Commission indicates serious human rights violations.[293] Any measure that may be taken by the Commission within its protective mandate remains confidential until the AU Assembly decides otherwise.[294] 5. Other Bodies Related to the African Union 5.1. Committee of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa (CISSA) CISSA was established on 26 August 2004 in Abuja, Nigeria, by the Heads of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa. It was endorsed at the 4th ordinary session of AU Assembly in Abuja, in January 2005.[295] CISSA is envisaged to provide leadership on intelligence and security matters in furtherance of peace, security and stability in Africa. It does so by facilitating dialogue, study, analysis, consultation, coordination and adoption of common strategies towards common security challenges among Intelligence and Security Organizations in Africa. CISSA has three permanent bodies: the Conference, composed of Heads of Intelligence and Security Services of Member States; the Panel of Experts (PoE), comprising the representatives from each member of CISSA; and the Secretariat, which is based in Addis Ababa for easy coordination with the African Union. The Secretariat is staffed on the principle of equitable regional representation by officers, recruited from Intelligence and Security Services that are Members of CISSA. 5.2. African Union Advisory Board on Corruption The Advisory Board on Corruption was established as part of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption which was adopted in July 2003 and entered into force in August 2006. The Board’s mandate is to promote and encourage States Parties to adopt measures and actions to meet the Convention’s objectives, and to follow up the application of those measures.[296] The Convention objectives include, inter alia, to promote and strengthen the development in Africa by each State Party of mechanisms required to prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption and related offences in the public and private sectors; promote, facilitate and regulate cooperation among the State Parties to ensure the effectiveness of such measures and actions; coordinate and harmonize relevant policies and legislation between State Parties.[297] The Advisory Board is composed of eleven (11) members who serve in their personal capacities for two years, renewable once.[298] The Board members are elected by the Executive Council from among a list of experts nominated by Member States, and who are of the highest integrity, impartiality, and recognized competence in matters relating to preventing and combating corruption and related offences. In the election of the members of the Board, the Executive Council is to ensure adequate gender representation, and equitable geographical representation.[299] The Advisory Board on Corruption is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[300] 5.3. African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL) The Statute establishing the African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL) was adopted and also entered into force in February 2009.[301] AUCIL was created as an independent advisory organ in accordance with article 5(2) of the AU Constitutive Act. AUCIL has 5 specific objectives: to undertake activities relating to codification and progressive development of international law; to propose draft framework agreements, model regulations, formulations and analyses of emerging trends in States’ practice to facilitate the codification and progressive development of international law; to assist in the revision of existing treaties, assist in the identification of areas in which new treaties are required and prepare drafts thereof; to conduct studies on legal matters of interest to the Union and its Member States; and to encourage the teaching, study, publication and dissemination of literature on international law; in particular the laws of the Union.[302] The members of AUCIL are elected by the AU Executive Council based on the principles of equitable geographical representation, the principal legal systems and gender representation. The eleven (11) members serve in their personal capacities, and must have recognised competence in international law. No two members shall be nationals of the same State.[303] Members are elected by secret ballot,[304] for five-year terms, renewable once.[305] Members perform their duties on a part-time basis.[306] AUCIL is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[307] 5.4. Treaty Bodies, Specialized Agencies and Other Bodies 5.4.1. African Union-Inter-African Phyto-Sanitary Council (AU-IAPSC) The Phyto-Sanitary Convention for Africa was adopted in September 1967 and entered into force in October 1992. AU-IAPSC is a technical office of the AU Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture. It is one of the 10 Regional Plant Protection Organizations of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). AU-IAPSC works with the national plant protection organizations of Member States of the AU on phyto-sanitary issues in Africa; including the vulnerability of African crop production systems to the impact of diseases, insect pests, and noxious weeds; economic losses incurred through spoilage; noncompliance with ISPMs, trade regulations, and equivalents; and dearth of phyto-sanitary data.[308] AU-IAPSC generally implements its activities through the eight (8) African Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and sub-RECs.[309] AU-IAPSC is governed by a General Assembly, Steering Committee and Secretariat, under the umbrella of the AU. AU-IAPSC is based in Yaoundé, Cameroon.[310] 5.4.2. African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) The African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) was created by the Constitutional Conference jointly convened by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa in 1964. AFCAC began functioning in 1969 and its Constitution was adopted by the OAU in January 1969 and entered into force in March 1972. It became an OAU specialized agency on 11 May 1978. The AU adopted the revised Constitution in 2003 and 2009.[311] The revised 2009 Constitution provisionally entered into force in May 2010.[312] The objectives of AFCAO include coordinating civil aviation matters in Africa and cooperating with ICAO and all other relevant organizations and other bodies which are involved in the promotion and development of civil aviation in Africa; facilitating, coordinating and ensuring the successful implementation of the Yamoussoukro Decision by supervising and managing Africa&#39;s liberalized air transport industry; and formulating and enforcing appropriate rules and regulations that give fair and equal opportunity to all stakeholders and promote fair competition.[313] AFCAC governance structure is made up of 3 organs: the Bureau, the Secretariat and the Plenary. The triennial Plenary of all Member States is the supreme organ of AFCAC.[314] The Bureau is composed of a president, five vice-presidents (one for each geographical region of Africa), and the Coordinator of the African Group of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council.[315] The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General.[316] AFCAC is based in Dakar-Yoff, Senegal.[317] On 28 January 2018, 23 African countries launched the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM), an initiative of the African Union. Largely based on the agreements of the 1999 Yamoussoukro Decision, the initiative will enhance connectivity between African nations and lead to a reduction in flight ticket prices.[318] 5.4.3. African Rehabilitation Institute (ARI) In 1988, the African Rehabilitation Institute (ARI) was established in Harare, Zimbabwe. ARI was set up to promote and develop training and research programmes in the field of rehabilitation and disability prevention in Africa.[319] The Institute consists of a Central Planning and Co-coordinating Unit and existing institutions and facilities throughout the African region form the decentralized branches of the ARI.[320] The organs of the Institute are the Conference of African Ministers responsible for Social Affairs; the Governing Board; the Technical Advisory Committee; and the General Secretariat of the Institute; and the Regional Centres.[321] ARI collaborates with African governments, African and international non-governmental organizations, and UN specialized agencies to develop African self-reliance in disability-related fields. Membership is open to all AU Member States, international organizations and non-governmental organizations.[322] 5.4.4. Secretariat to the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Importation into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes Within Africa The Bamako Convention bans the importation of hazardous wastes.[323] The objective of the Convention is to strictly regulate the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes to and within Africa. The Convention provides for a Secretariat to serve a Conference of the Parties along with financial arrangements.[324] The Conference of Parties which took place in Bamako, Mali, in June 2013 agreed that UN Environment Programme (UNEP) should host the Secretariat for the Bamako Convention, and that designated Centres for the Basel and Stockholm conventions in Africa are ipso facto designated centres for the Bamako Convention.[325] 5.4.5. Secretariat to the African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (Maputo Convention) The Maputo Convention is a revised version of the Algiers Convention of 1968 on the same topic.[326] The Maputo Convention has stronger institutional mechanisms for effective implementation than the Algiers Convention.[327] The Revised Convention entered into force on 11 July 2016.[328] The objectives of the Convention are to enhance environmental protection; foster the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources; and harmonize and coordinate policies in these fields with a view to achieving ecologically rational, economically sound and socially acceptable development policies and programmes.[329] The AU Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture currently acts as the Convention Secretariat. 5.4.6. African Energy Commission (AFREC) AFREC was established by the Convention of the African Energy Commission, which was adopted in July 2001 and entered into force in December 2006. AFREC is an AU Commission technical agency responsible for supporting the energy sector’s functions of developing and managing energy resources across Africa. AFREC’s objectives include to map out energy development policies, strategies and plans based on sub-regional, regional and continental development priorities and recommend their implementation; design, create and update an energy continental data base and facilitate rapid dissemination of information and exchange of information among Member States, as well as among the Regional Economic Communities (RECs); and to encourage research and development in the energy sector.[330] AFREC reports to the Conference of African Energy Ministers CAMEN. The African Electrotechnical Standardization Commission (AFSEC), a subsidiary of AFREC was launched in February 2008. AFREC is based in Algiers, Algeria.[331] 5.4.7. African Commission on Nuclear Energy (AFCONE) The African Commission on Nuclear Energy (AFCONE) was established by the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty (Pelindaba Treaty) which was adopted in November 2001 and entered into force in July 2009. The Parties are obliged not to conduct research on, develop, manufacture, stockpile or otherwise acquire, possess, or have control over any nuclear explosive device by any means anywhere; not to seek or receive any assistance in the research on, development, manufacture, stockpiling or acquisition, or possession of any nuclear explosive device; and not to take any action to assist or encourage the research on, development, manufacture, stockpiling or acquisition, or possession of any nuclear explosive device.[332] The Parties also undertake to prohibit, in their territory, the stationing of any nuclear explosive device.[333] The Commission promotes peaceful nuclear cooperation, at the bilateral, sub-regional and regional levels.[334] The first Conference of States Parties agreed that its headquarters will be in South Africa. Currently, AFCONE is based at the AU Commission’s Department of Infrastructure and Energy in Addis Ababa, pending the establishment of a permanent secretariat in South Africa. 5.4.8. African Union Institute for Statistics The African Charter on Statistics was adopted on 4 February 2009 and entered into force in February 2015. The objectives of the Charter, inter alia, are to serve as the policy framework for, and as an advocacy tool and instrument for statistics development in Africa; and to ensure improved quality and comparability of the statistics required to monitor the economic and social integration process in the continent.[335] In 2015, the AU Assembly approved the establishment of two (2) institutions: the AU Institute of Statistics to be based in Tunis, Tunisia and the African Statistical Training Centre that will be based in Yamoussoukro, Cote d’Ivoire.[336] Both institutions shall be established under article 7 of the African Charter on Statistics which provides for an appropriate mechanism for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Charter. The institutions were expected to start operation in 2016.[337] On 2 February 2018, the Department of Economic Affairs and Tunisian Government officials signed the Host Agreement for the African Union Institute for Statistics in Africa (STATAFRIC) to be based in Tunis.[338] 5.4.9. Pan African Youth Union The Pan African Youth Movement (PYM), the predecessor of the Pan African Youth Union (PYU), was established on April 26, 1962.

Members are elected every three years. PYU is led by a President and the General Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General. The head office of AYU is in Pretoria, South Africa. The AYU held its 5th Triennial Ordinary Congress in Khartoum, Sudan in December, 2017.[340] 5.4.10. African Airlines Association (AFRAA) The African Airlines Association (AFRAA) was established in April 1968 in Accra, Ghana, as a trade organization with membership open to African states’ airlines. AFRAA is an AU specialized agency established under the auspices of the OAU. The objectives of AFRAA include: to facilitate the establishment of industry best practices in safety and security; to be the repository of data and its analysis; provide a platform for consensus building among member carriers; facilitate joint projects between member airlines; support human capital development; interact with the regulatory bodies; provide a knowledge exchange forum; facilitate the development of environmental policies in keeping with industry best practices; and reflect a positive image of African airlines worldwide.[341] The Annual General Assembly, composed of the Chief Executives of member airlines is the highest policy making body of the Association. The Annual General Assembly is presided over by the Association’s President, while executive authority is exercised by a twelve (12) member Executive Committee, elected on a sub-regional basis. The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General and serves as the administrative, co-ordination and research centre for the Association.[342] 5.4.11. African Telecommunications Union (ATU) The African Telecommunications Union (ATU) was founded in 1977 as an OAU specialized agency. ATU is the leading continental organization fostering developments of information and communications technologies infrastructure and services. ATU’s mission is to promote the rapid development of the ICTs in Africa in order to achieve universal service and access to broadband. ATU’s objectives include promoting the development and adoption of appropriate African telecommunications policy and regulatory frameworks; the financing and funding of telecommunications development and programmes for the development of the African Information Society.[343] The organs of ATU are the Conference of Plenipotentiaries, the Administrative Council, the Technical and Development Conference, and the General Secretariat.[344] The Conference of Plenipotentiaries is the supreme organ of the Union. It consists of duly accredited delegations of Member States headed by the Ministers in charge of telecommunications or any other Plenipotentiaries designated by Member States.[345] ATU is administered by a Secretariat comprising a Secretary-General assisted by the Directors of Sectors, Heads of Departments and an Internal Auditor.[346] ATU has 23 associate members composed of fixed and mobile telecom operators.[347] The seat of ATU is in Nairobi, Kenya.[348] 5.4.12. Pan African Postal Union (PAPU) PAPU was established on 17 January 1980 by the Pan African Postal Union Convention.[349] The Convention entered into force in July 1980.

African Union Observatory for Science, Technology and Innovation (AOSTI) In February 2009, the AU Assembly at its 12th Summit in Addis Ababa endorsed Equatorial Guinea’s offer to host the Observatory for Science, Technology and Innovation (AOSTI).[357] At the joint meeting of the African Union (AU)-UNESCO Commission held on 9-12 March 2009, the AU requested assistance from UNESCO in establishing AOSTI. The AU Assembly adopted the Statute of the African Observatory in Science Technology and Innovation at its 26th ordinary session in January 2016.[358] The aim of AOSTI is to stimulate and promote the use of science and technology in supporting sustainable development in Africa. The AOSTI is a continental repository for science, technology and innovation (STI) statistics and a source of policy analysis in support of evidence based policy making in order to assist Africa countries manage and use statistical information in accordance with the African Charter of Statistics.[359] The objectives of AOSTI include: enabling African countries to use their STI capabilities to solve pressing economic, social, environmental and other development challenges; strengthening national capacities for STI policy formulation, implementation, evaluation and review; provide African decision-makers with current STI information; strengthening national and RECs capacities for technology prospecting, acquisition or procurement; and reinforcing regional and international STI cooperation.[360] The AOSTI is governed by the AU Specialized Technical Committee on Education, Science and Technology (STC), the Steering Committee and the Secretariat.[361] AOSTI is based in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.[362] 5.4.14. Pan African University (PAU) The Pan African University is an initiative of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union. It is a premier continental university network whose mission is to provide wholesome postgraduate education geared towards the achievement of a prosperous, integrated and peaceful Africa.[363] The AU Assembly adopted the Statutes of the Pan African University at its 20th ordinary session in January 2013.[364] The Pan African University is an academic network of existing African institutions operating at graduate level.[365] PAU is supported by the Association of African Universities. PAU is expected to create high quality continental institutions to bridge the educational gap between Africa and other parts of the world and to promote innovative teaching, learning and research within Africa. PAU’s objectives include: developing continent-wide and world-class graduate and postgraduate programmes in science, technology, innovation, humanities and social sciences and governance; stimulating collaborative, internationally competitive, leading edge fundamental and economic growth-oriented research; and enhancing the mobility of students and academic staff among African universities to improve teaching and collaborative research.[366] Article 14 of the PAU Statute provides for the establishment of an endowment fund based on voluntary contributions from AU Member States, Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and AU partners. PAU is designed to operate in a series of thematic hubs in five geographic sub-regions.[367] The five thematic areas are: Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya; Life and Earth Sciences, including Health and Agriculture at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria; Governance, Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Yaoundé II, and the University of Buea, Cameroon; Water and Energy Sciences, including climate change, at the University of Tlemcen, Algeria.

The Revised Statutes of the Pan African University provides for five PAU management organs: the PAU Council, the Rectorate, Directorates of Institutes, Boards of Institutes, and the PAU Senate.[368] The Rector of the PAU is equivalent in rank to the Vice Chancellor of the host University housing the PAU Institute. Cameroon is the host country of PAU’s Rectorate.[369] 5.4.15. African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency The AU Assembly at its 19th ordinary session in Addis Ababa in July 2012 endorsed in principle the proposal to establish a financial entity, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency.[370] The Agreement for the Establishment of the African Risk Capacity has entered into force.[371] The objective of the ARC Agency is to assist the Member states to reduce the risk of loss and damage caused by extreme weather events and natural disasters therefore protecting the food security of their vulnerable populations.[372] The ARC Agency uses Africa RiskView, an advanced satellite weather surveillance and software, developed by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), to estimate and trigger readily available funds to African countries hit by severe weather events.[373] The organs of the ARC Agency are the Conference of the Parties; the Governing Board; and the Secretariat.[374] The Conference of the Parties is composed of all Parties to the Agreement, represented by Ministers or authorized representatives.[375] The quorum for a Conference of the Parties shall be a simple majority of the Parties of the ARC Agency.[376] The Governing Board is composed of five (5) members, and one (1) alternate for each such member.[377] The Secretariat is currently headed by the first African General Manager.[378] The ARC Agency is based in Johannesburg, South Africa.[379] 5.4.16. Pan African Intellectual Property Organisation (PAIPO) In January 2013, the AU Assembly at its 20th ordinary summit in Addis Ababa agreed to establish the Pan African Intellectual Property Organization (PAIPO).[380] The creation of PAIPO was first proposed at the 5th ordinary session of the African Union Conference of Ministers in charge of Science and Technology (AMCOST V) held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, from 12 to 15 November 2012.[381] The creation of PAIPO is in recognition of the need to address the continued need to promote creativity and utilization of the Intellectual Property system amongst Member States.[382] Tunisia has offered to host PAIPO.[383] PAIPO is scheduled to begin operations in 2018 and be fully functional by 2023.[384] Its Statute was adopted in January 2016[385] and will enter into force 30 days after 15 Member States have ratified it.[386] As at 8 February, 2018, 3 member states have signed the Statute but none has ratified it. PAIPO will be composed of a Conference of States Parties, Council of Ministers, Secretariat and Board of Appeal, [387] and will be based in Tunisia.[388] 6. The Relation Between the AU and Sub-Regional Organizations Currently there are over ten sub-regional organizations in Africa. The African Union initially recognized eight sub-regional organizations: Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Common Market of East and Southern Africa (COMESA), Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD), Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), Economic Community of Sahelo-Saharian States (CEN-SAD) and East African Community (EAC).[389] The AU has recognized two additional sub-regional organizations: the East African Stand-by Force Command (EASFCOM) and the North African Regional Capability (NARC).[390] The African sub-regional organizations were initially established as economic communities in their respective sub-region. There is no clear framework to coordinate the economic objectives of the AU with the sub-regional organizations. Moreover, the major sub-regional organizations have developed norms and institutions on security. In this regard, the Peace and Security Council Protocol provides that the sub-regional organizations are part and parcel of the continental security architecture.[391] The African Common Defense and Security Policy reaffirms that sub-regional organizations are the implementing institutions of the AU norms on the prevention, management and resolution of conflict under the umbrella of the Peace and Security Council.[392] In January 2008, the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation on Peace and Security between the AU and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs)/ Regional Mechanisms (RMs) for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was concluded in Addis Ababa.[393] All REC/RMs have signed the MOU. The last to do so was the North African Regional Capability (NARC), in September 2011. In the framework of this MOU, the parties hold regular meetings, joint missions and consultations, inter alia, working together to make the African Standby Force (ASF) fully operational. 7. The Status of the AU Under the UN Charter The UN Charter provides the following characteristics of regional organizations under Article 52(1): Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided that such arrangement or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations. The words ‘agencies’ or ‘arrangements’ under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter refer to the kind of regional organisation that member States may establish.[394] Thus, ‘arrangements’ are organisations based on multilateral treaties among States while ‘agencies’ refer to regional organisations with various kinds of organs of implementation of the multilateral treaties.[395] The criteria for determining whether an organisation is a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter are two: [396] 1) The organisation should play a role in the maintenance of international peace and security as is appropriate for regional action. 2) The objectives of organisation and its activities should be compatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. When seen against the above criteria, the AU can be characterised as a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter as it is meant to play a role in the maintenance of peace and security in Africa[397] and observe the purposes and principles of the UN.[398] Moreover, the Protocol for the establishment of the AU Peace and Security Council as well as the various statements of the AU organs indicate that the AU considers itself as a regional organization within the meaning of Article 52(1) of the UN Charter.[399] For instance, in its 10th ordinary session, the AU Assembly called upon the UN ‘to examine, within the context of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, the possibility of funding, through assessed contributions, peacekeeping operations undertaken by African Union or under its authority and with the consent of the United Nations.’[400] In its various communications, the UN Security Council has also recognised the AU as a regional organisation within the parameter of the principles laid down in Articles 52 and 53 of the UN Charter. [401] 8. The Status of the AU Treaties The transformation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) into the new continental organization of the AU in 2001 makes it necessary to discuss the current status of the treaties that were signed and ratified under the aegis of the OAU. Currently there are 61 treaties under the auspices of the African Union, and 30 of these treaties have entered into force. Note that the above information may not be correct as not all OAU/AU Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and Charters are listed in the AU website.[402] About 33 per cent of these treaties were adopted under the auspices of OAU, the predecessor of the AU. The treaties adopted under the OAU are assumed by the AU and continue to be binding on those States, which have signed and ratified them. 9.

This is the case with the United Nations Charter where some countries have withdrawn notwithstanding that it is not mentioned textually. Libya’s proposal is that this right should not be mentioned in the Act, as if states are being invited to withdraw or denounce the Act’. In the text of the same document of the proposed amendment under Article 31, Libya went further than its explanatory notes and stated that Article 31 should be deleted because ‘a state whose policy-making bodies have ratified the Constitutive Act has no grounds to withdraw from the Union, renounce its membership and request that the Act should cease to apply to it.’ [32] Constitutive Act (n 17) preamble paragraph 1 provides that member States are ‘inspired by the noble ideals which guided the founding fathers of our Continental Organisation OAU and generations of Pan-Africanists in their determination to promote unity, solidarity, cohesion and cooperation among the peoples of Africa and African States’.

Background: The Transformation of the OAU into the AU 1.1. The OAU The Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union, was established by the then independent states of Africa on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[1] The OAU Charter served as a roadmap for the efforts and actions of the independent African States to liberate the continent from colonialism and apartheid. By the end of the 1970s, much of Africa was liberated from colonialism with the exception of the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe. This new reality in Africa led to the call for the review of the OAU Charter as early as 1979. The sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held in Monrovia, Liberia, in July 1979 established the OAU Charter Review Committee (the Committee) in a bid “to re-examine the provisions of the Charter in light of the changes and realities in Africa.”[2] The Committee was meant to make a detailed study of the OAU Charter in light of the current needs of the continent and come up with specific proposals for new norms and institutions that would have been instrumental in responding to the atrocities like the Rwandan genocide. The Committee attempted to forward a proposal for new rules and institutions that would make the Charter more effective.[3] Nevertheless, the activities of the Committee were very slow and highly marginalised because of the absence of active involvement of member States. New developments on the continent and worldwide, such as the total liberation of African States from colonialism, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the challenges of massive human rights violations inside independent African States and intra-state and inter-state conflicts and the end of the cold war made the transformation of the OAU a necessity. 1.2. The Sirte Declaration and the Establishment of the African Union By July 1999, when the OAU Thirty-Fifth Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Algiers, it was clear that the OAU Charter Review Committee had failed to achieve its purpose. The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government accepted a call for an extraordinary meeting on the issue of the transformation of the OAU[4] and decided to hold its 4th extraordinary meeting ‘to discuss ways and means of making the OAU effective so as to keep pace with political and economic developments taking place in the world and the preparation required of Africa within the context of globalization so as to preserve its socio-economic and political potentials.[5] Accordingly, the fourth extraordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Sirte, Libya on 8-9 September 1999 and adopted the Sirte Declaration, which inter alia called for the establishment of the African Union: Article 8: “Having discussed frankly and extensively on how to proceed with the strengthening of the unity of our continent and its peoples, in the light of those proposals, and bearing in mind the current situation on the Continent, we decide to: (i) Establish an African Union, in conformity with the ultimate objectives of the Charter of our Continental Organization and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.”[6] The Sirte Declaration did not specify the details of the new organisation. Rather the Declaration instructed the Council of Ministers and the Secretary-General of the OAU to work on the details of the establishment of the new organisation (African Union) and report their work to the next ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.[7] Accordingly, the OAU Secretary-General established a Departmental Task Force under the Chairmanship of the OAU Assistant-Secretary General for Political Affairs to design the steps that should be taken by the OAU Secretariat to implement the Sirte Declaration.[8] The Departmental Task force recommended involvement of expert consultants to develop the preparatory documents for the Constitutive Act of the African Union in collaboration with the OAU Secretariat.[9] In February 2000, a group of consultants with backgrounds in law, economics and politics met in Addis Ababa and came up with a draft Constitutive Act of the African Union.[10] After consultation by the OAU Secretariat with member states, the draft Constitutive Act together with earlier draft proposals from member states were presented to two consecutive meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians on the establishment of the African Union that were held on 17-20 April 2000 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and 27-29 May 2000 in Tripoli, Libya respectively.[11] The meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and presented their assessment to a Ministerial Conference on the Establishment of the African Union on 31 May - 2 June 2000 in Tripoli, Libya. The Ministerial Conference reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and decided to establish a working group to further elaborate on the draft Constitutive Act.[12] The working group submitted the revised draft Constitutive Act to the Seventy-second ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers on 6-8 July 2000 in Lomé, Togo.[13] After further deliberations, the OAU Council of Ministers approved the draft Constitutive Act and recommended its submission to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government for adoption.[14] The thirty-sixth ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of the Heads of State and Government held in Lomé, Togo on 10-12 July 2000 adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union and urged member states of the OAU to ratify the Constitutive Act as soon as possible.[15] The fifth extraordinary meeting of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government declared the political birth of the African Union and noted that the Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) would enter in to force 30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification by two-thirds of the member States of the OAU, as provided for in Article 28 of the Constitutive Act.[16] The Constitutive Act entered into force on 26 May 2001 upon ratification by two thirds of member States of the OAU replacing the OAU Charter.[17] The African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held its inaugural session in Durban, South Africa, on 9 July 2002.[18] 2. Membership of the African Union There are three requirements for membership in the African Union (AU). First, a State should be an African State.[19] Second, a simple majority of member states supports the application for membership,[20] and third, the African State should sign and ratify the AU Constitutive Act.[21] “After withdrawing in 1984 from the OAU, the predecessor of the AU, Morocco re-joined the AU as its 55th member on 20 January 2017.”[22] Several countries have at various times been suspended from membership of the AU. Suspension is the AU’s usual response to any interruption of constitutional rule by a member.[23] The Assembly also recognises representatives of the African Diaspora,[24] and passed a Resolution inviting its representatives as observers to Assembly sessions.[25] Haiti was granted Observer Status on 2 February 2012 and its request to become an associate member was denied on 17 May 2016. The AU emphasized that according to its statutes only African states can join the African Union.[26] There are no criteria set in the Constitutive Act as standards for the vote on the request for accession. Moreover, all AU member States have the same rights and obligations. The Constitutive Act does not provide for a veto power or any kind of special status for any member State of the AU. Withdrawal of membership is allowed after a member State notifies in writing its intention to renounce its membership of the Union to the Chairperson of the AU Commission, who will communicate such notification to the other State parties of the Constitutive Act.[27] The applicant should wait one year from the date of notification of its intention to renounce membership before its rights and obligations under the Constitutive Act are terminated.[28] The rights and obligations of the Member State remain intact during the one year window period.[29] After a window period of one year, the applicant is deemed to have withdrawn its membership if it does not rescind its decision to renounce its membership. Article 12 of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act provides for the repeal of the right to renounce membership.[30] The explanatory notes accompanying the proposal for the removal of the right recognizes that renunciation of membership is the right of member States but nevertheless argues for the deletion of the right as it has a negative connotation on the unity of the region.[31] 3. The Objectives and Principles of the African Union Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitutive Act of the AU enumerate the objectives and principles of the regional organization. The objectives and principles can be summarized into the following six interrelated areas. The first three sub-sections focus on the objectives while the last three focus on explaining the principles that are meant to be used to achieve the objectives. 3.1. Regional Integration The AU is planned to be a forum for the promotion of regional integration and African unity through socio-economic integration, continental research on all fields including science and technology and the development of common positions on issues of common interest.[32] The AU also establishes institutions that nurture solidarity among African peoples, coordinate its actions with sub-regional economic communities and forges a common front in international negotiations and cooperation.[33] 3.2. Peace and Security The AU member States recognize that ‘the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent.’[34] Thus, one important objective area of the AU is the establishment of collective security system in a bid to promote peace and security as a prerequisite for development on the continent.[35] The focus on peace and security can also be gathered from the new norms and institutions of collective security that member States established.[36] AU member States pledge to strengthen and provide necessary mandate and resources to all relevant institutions including institutions for the maintenance of collective security.[37] 3.3. Protection of Human Rights The protection of human rights is provided as one major objective for the establishment of the AU. One reason given by member States for establishing the AU is their determination ‘to promote and protect human and peoples’ rights, consolidate democratic institutions and culture, and to ensure good governance and the rule of law.’[38] Thus, the AU member States set the observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one objective of the organization.[39] Moreover, the promotion of ‘democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance’ is provided as an objective of the organization within the promotion and protection of the rights of African people. [40] 3.4. Non-Intervention The AU Constitutive Act rules out unilateral intervention between member States. Unilateral intervention among member States is pointed out as a common security threat on the continent.[41] Apart from the direct principle of ‘non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another,’[42] the non-intervention norm is expressed through many principles of the organisation. For instance, the Constitutive Act rejects subversive activities in member States.[43] Subversion is defined as constituting ‘any act that incites, aggravates or creates dissension within or among Member States with the intention or purpose to destabilize or overthrow the existing regime or political order by, among other means, fomenting racial, religious, linguistic, ethnic and other differences’ in violation of the Constitutive Act and the Charter of the United Nations.[44] Thus, subversion does not only include the use or threat of military force, which is prohibited under the Constitutive Act,[45] but also the non-military means of interference.[46] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the AU proposes two additional principles on subversion that request ‘restraint by any Member State from entering into any treaty or alliance that is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the Union’ and prohibit ‘any Member State from allowing the use of its territory as a base for subversion against another Member State.’[47] The AU non-intervention principle is based on the principles of sovereign equality and interdependence among member States and respect of borders existing on achievement of independence.[48] The principles of ‘peaceful co-existence of Member States and their right to live in peace and security’ and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among member States are also the basis of the non-intervention norm among member States of the AU. [49] 3.5. Intervention Intervention in member States under the AU constitutes an unprecedented principle under international law. The AU is endowed with the right to intervene ‘in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.’[50] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union adds ‘a serious threat to legitimate order to restore peace and stability to the Member State of the Union’ as an additional element that would trigger intervention by the AU in a member State as well as crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.[51] AU member States have also agreed on the right to ‘request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and security.’[52] This is a case of intervention by invitation. The request for intervention from a member State is made to the Assembly of the AU, which is the highest decision-making organ.[53] 3.6. Respect for Democracy and Rule of Law AU member States have acknowledged the relation between democracy, rule of law and economic development. The principles of respect for democracy, rule of law, and good governance are adopted as precondition for social justice that ensures economic development in member States of the AU.[54] The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (a.k.a NEPAD) is one framework launched by African States that links the respect for civil and political rights with the right to development in member States of the AU.[55] AU member States adopted the principle of ‘condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of governments.’[56] The rejection of impunity is also a principle adopted by the AU member States that strengthen their commitment to the rule of law.[57] 4. The Institutions of the African Union Article 5 of the AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the following institutions of the Union: the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Specialized Technical Committees, the Pan-African Parliament, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights,[58] the Financial Institutions, the Commission, the Permanent Representatives Committee, and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council.[59] Another key institution, which was not directly established by the Constitutive Act, is the AU Peace and Security Council. A brief exposition based on the Constitutive Act and respective protocols of the institution follows. 4.1. The Assembly The AU Assembly is the supreme decision-making organ of the Union.[60] It is composed of the Heads of State and Government of all member States of the African Union or their accredited representatives.[61] The Assembly meets at least once in a year in an ordinary session and convenes for an extra ordinary meeting at the request of a member State and upon the approval of two-third majority of member States.[62] In its 2004 summit the AU Assembly decided to meet twice a year in ordinary session citing its increasing responsibilities in the face of the many challenges of the continent.[63] All the sessions of the Assembly are to be held at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[64] However, the Assembly can hold its session elsewhere if a member State extends invitation to host the session. The inviting State should not be under sanction from the AU and should be able to meet pre-determined criteria such as paying up all financial obligations to the Union and maintaining favourable political atmosphere.[65] The Assembly should hold at least one session at the headquarters of the Union every other year based on its calendar.[66] As a matter of rule all sessions of the Assembly are closed.[67] However, the Assembly may decide to hold open sessions with a vote of simple majority.[68] The decisions of the Assembly are made either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority of the member States of the Union.[69] The Assembly is led by a Chairperson elected among the heads of State or government for a period of one year.[70] The Chairperson of the Assembly is generally elected after consultations among member States and based on the principle of rotation.[71] However, as an exception to the rule, the head of state or government of a host country which has invited the Assembly for its proceedings is given the automatic right to be the Chairperson of the Assembly.[72] The Chairperson of the Assembly is assisted by the Bureau for each summit composed of fourteen Vice-Chairpersons elected based on geographical distribution and due consultations.[73] The Chairperson is responsible, inter alia, to convene the sessions of the Assembly, guide the proceedings of the Assembly, rule on point of order and in consultation with the Chairperson of the Commission represents the Union in between sessions.[74] As the supreme organ of the Union, the Assembly determines the policies of all organs of the Union.[75] It monitors the implementation of policies and decisions by its organs and takes decisions on reports and recommendations from its organs such as a recommendation for intervention in member States from the Peace and Security Council.[76] In particular the Assembly directs the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and the Commission on management of conflicts, acts of terrorism and emergency situations.[77] The Assembly is mandated to impose sanctions on member States for violation of the principles enshrined in the Constitutive Act.[78] Moreover, the Assembly adopts the budget of the Union and appoints and removes the judges to both the African Human Rights Court and the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, when operational.[79] The structure, functions and regulations of the AU Commission,[80] the administrative wing of the organization, is determined by the Assembly.[81] The Assembly appoints the Chairperson of the Commission and his/her deputies as well as all other Commissioners of the Union and determines their functions and terms of office.[82] The Assembly is also given power of interpretation of the Constitutive Act until the establishment of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.[83] The Assembly has the right to delegate its powers and functions to any organ of the AU.[84] The Assembly delegated its powers to the Peace and Security Council (PSC), the standing decision-making organ for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in 2004.[85] The Assembly recently established the High-Level Committee of Heads of State and Government on the Post-2015 Development Agenda[86] and the High-Level Panel on Alternative Sources of Financing.[87] Another important innovation of the AU is Agenda 2063. Adopted by the Heads of State and Governments of the AU during the 24th Ordinary Assembly held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 30-31 January 2015, Agenda 2063 ‘is a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years’. Its builds on, and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development, such as the Lagos Plan of Action, The Abuja Treaty, The Minimum Integration Programme, the Programme for Infrastructural Development in Africa (PIDA), the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), The New partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), Regional Plans and Programmes and National Plans. It is also built on national, regional, continental best practices in its formulation.[88] 4.2. The Executive Council The Executive Council is another decision-making organ composed of the ministers of foreign affairs or equivalent authorities designated by the governments of the member States of the AU.[89] The Executive Council is directly accountable to the Assembly.[90] The details of most decisions and policies of the Assembly of the Union are worked out by the Council before they are presented to the Assembly for final decision.[91] The Executive Council has the power to make its own binding decisions on common interest of member States such as foreign trade, energy, transport and communication, education, culture, health, and immigration.[92] The Executive Council can also make binding decisions in other areas based on the powers delegated to it by the Assembly.[93] The Executive Council has three Sub-Committees which operate at ministerial level.[94] The Ministerial Committee on Candidatures is responsible for promoting African candidates for positions in international bodies; the Ad-Hoc Ministerial Committee on the Review of Scale of Assessment is responsible for reviewing the scale of assessment for Member State contributions to the AU budget;[95] and the Ministerial Committee on the Challenges of Ratification/Accession and Implementation of the OAU/AU Treaties.[96] The Executive Council meets at least twice a year in ordinary sessions while extraordinary meetings can be held when a member state requires and two-thirds of the member States support the request.[97] In practice, the Executive Council holds its meetings immediately before every session of the AU Assembly. The meeting of the Executive Council is chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or equivalent authority whose country holds the Chair of the Assembly or in case of extraordinary session the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the host member State.[98] As a rule all sessions of the Executive Council are closed unless the Council decides by simple majority to hold open meetings. [99] The Executive Council makes its decisions by consensus or, failing which, by a two-thirds majority of the member States.[100] The Executive Council is assisted by the Permanent Representative Committee[101] and the seven Specialized Technical Committees of the AU. 4.3. The Specialized Technical Committees The Specialized Technical Committees are various committees responsible for, inter alia, the preparation and coordination of the projects and programs of the Union and supervision and follow-up of the policies of the Union or any function assigned by the Executive Council.[102] The Specialized Committees are accountable to the Executive Council.[103] The Committees are composed of ministers or senior officials of member States responsible for rural economy and agriculture; monetary and financial affairs; trade, customs and immigration matters; industry, science and technology, energy, natural resources and environment; transport, communications and tourism; Health, Labour and Social Affairs; and Education, Culture and Human Resources.[104] The Assembly has the mandate to add other relevant committees or reorganize the existing Specialized Committees as it deems fit.[105] The Specialized Technical Committees meet as often as required by their tasks or as directed by the Executive Council.[106] 4.4. The Permanent Representatives Committee The Permanent Representative Committee (PRC) is a body composed of permanent representatives of member States to the AU resident at the Headquarters of the Union in Addis Ababa or other duly accredited plenipotentiaries of member States.[107] The PRC is accountable to the Executive Council.[108] The PRC serves as an advisory body to Executive Council.[109] The PRC prepares the bulk of the work of the Executive Council, carrying out most of the practical activities for the Executive Council including the preparation and recommendation of agendas for the sessions of the Executive Council and drafting proposals for decisions of the Executive Council.[110] The PRC monitors the implementation of the budget of the Union and the decisions of the Executive Council.[111] The Executive Council can assign more functions to the PRC.[112] The PRC can establish ad-hoc committees and working groups to carry out its tasks. The PRC has eleven (11) sub-Committees on: Administrative, Budgetary and Financial Matters; Audit Matters; Contributions; Economic and Trade Matters; Headquarters and Host Agreements; Multilateral Cooperation and Strategic Partnerships; New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); Programmes and Conferences; Refugees; Structures; and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine Relief in Africa,[113] and Rules, Standards and Credentials.[114] The PRC is also the organ that facilitates the communication between the Commission of the AU and member States.[115] The PRC holds its sessions at the headquarters of the AU at least once in a month chaired by the Permanent Representative whose country holds the chair of the Executive Council.[116] All the sessions of the PRC are closed unless the PRC decides by simple majority to hold open meetings.[117] 4.5. The Peace and Security Council The Peace and Security Council with its supporting institutions is the main pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture (ASPA). The ASPA is the umbrella term for the key AU mechanisms for promoting peace, security and stability in the African continent.[118] 4.5.1. Establishment The Protocol on the Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union[119] established the Peace and Security Council as one the organs of the AU in accordance with article 5 (2) of the Constitutive Act.[120] In the initial process of establishing the AU, the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was incorporated and retained as a peace and security organ of the AU based on Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act.[121] Following the incorporation of the Central Organ, the OAU Assembly requested the OAU Secretary-General to undertake a review of the structures, procedures and working methods of the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism, including the possibility of changing its name.[122] The OAU Secretary-General presented his report and the draft protocol for the establishment of a new Peace and Security Council to the OAU Council of Ministers in July 2002 during the transition from OAU to the AU.[123] The draft protocol was presented to the first ordinary session of the Assembly of African Union held in Durban, South Africa. The Protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council was adopted by the first ordinary session of the AU Assembly and entered into force on 26 December 2003.[124] The Peace and Security Council is a permanent decision-making organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa established on the basis of Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act of the AU.[125] The Peace and Security Council is situated at the Headquarters of the African Union.[126] 4.5.2. Composition The 15 member States of the Peace and Security Council are elected by the AU Executive Council and endorsed by the AU Assembly. The election is based on the principles of equitable regional representation and national rotation, with three members from the centre, three members from the east, two members from the north, three members from the south and four members from the west of Africa.[127] There is no provision for permanent and non-permanent members of the Peace and Security Council.[128] However, the Peace and Security Council Protocol has provided detailed criteria for membership of States to the Council. The Peace and Security Council Protocol requires that prospective member States to the Peace and Security Council should exhibit, inter alia, respect for constitutional governance, the rule of law, the protection of human rights and the commitment to honour financial obligations of the Union.[129] Any AU member State that meets the criteria may apply for membership to the Peace and Security Council.[130] Initial election on the candidacy is preferably done by each sub-region of Africa which would later submit the candidates to the AU Assembly, the organ which makes the final selection.[131] The first members of the Peace and Security Council were elected by the Executive Council as delegated by the Assembly.[132] The Peace and Security Council Protocol also provides that the Assembly shall conduct a periodic review to assess the extent to which elected members of the Council continue to meet the membership criteria and ‘take action as appropriate’.[133] The phrase ‘take action as appropriate’ refers to the possibility of dismissal of a member State from the Peace and Security Council when it fails to fulfil the criteria of membership specified under Article 5(2) of the Peace and Security Council Protocol. 4.5.3. Subsidiary Bodies The PSC established two subsidiary bodies: the Committee of Experts and the Military Staff Committee, as authorized by its Protocol. The following proposed committees of the PSC: the Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD); Sanctions, Counter-Terrorism, Resource Mobilization; and Procedures and Mechanisms for Peace Support Operations are not yet operational. The Committee of Experts: The Committee of Experts was established to assist PSC prepare its draft decisions.[134] The Committee comprises of a designated expert representing each PSC Member State and the Peace and Security Department expert officers. The Committee meets before each PSC meeting. The Military Staff Committee: The Military Staff Committee (MSC) is a standing advisory body to the Peace and Security Council on military and related security matters.[135] The MSC is composed of Senior Military Officers of members of the Peace and Security Council.[136] However, the MSC can also meet at the level of Chiefs of Defence Staff of members of the Peace and Security Council.[137] The MSC members meet as often as required, and at least once in a month.[138] Even though the MSC is directly accountable to the Peace and Security Council, it can also consult with other relevant organs of the AU.[139] The meetings of the MSC follow the Rules of Procedure provided under the Policy Framework for the establishment of the ASF and MSC[140] and where applicable the rules of procedure of the Peace and Security Council.[141] 4.5.4. Supporting Institutions In implementing its mandate, the Peace and Security Council works with the various AU organs including the Assembly, Pan-African Parliament and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[142] The following organs were initially designated as supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council: the AU Commission, the Peace Fund, the Continental Early Warning System, the Panel of the Wise, the African Standby Force, and the Military Staff Committee.[143] Additional supporting institutions include the Friends of the Panel of the Wise, the Pan-African Network of the Wise (PanWise), the Committee of Experts, and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. A brief overview of each supporting institution follows. The AU Commission: The Peace and Security directorate is the main organ of the AU Commission responsible for providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council.[144] The Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission provides the Council with a permanent Secretariat to run its day to day activities.[145] Moreover, the Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission establishes and operationalise all the supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council namely the Continental Early Warning System, the African Standby Force and the Peace Fund and the Panel of the Wise.[146] Moreover, the Chairperson of the AU Commission has the responsibility to monitor the implementation of decisions adopted by the Peace and Security Council upon the approval of the Assembly.[147] In a bid to strengthen it, the Assembly plans to transform the African Union Commission into the African Union Authority.[148] The Peace Fund: The Peace and Security Council Protocol provides for the establishment of a Special Fund, known as the Peace Fund, in order to finance the activities of the AU aimed at maintaining peace and security in the continent.[149] In July 2016, the Assembly adopted the High Representative for the Fund recommendations to inter alia, have three thematic windows, Mediation and Preventive Diplomacy, Institutional Capacity and Peace Operations as well as clear governance structures and independent fund management. [150] The primary source of the Peace Fund is the regular budget to the African Union, known as the General Peace Fund.[151] The other major category of the Peace Fund is what is called the Special Contribution.[152] Under the Special Contribution, the sources of the Peace fund are voluntary contributions from AU member States, voluntary contributions from the private sector and civil society as well as individuals in AU member States and donations from non-member States.[153] Donations and voluntary contributions from sources outside of Africa are accepted in so far as they are ‘in conformity with the objectives and principles of the Union’. [154] The PSC Protocol also provides for a revolving trust fund within the broader Peace Fund, to provide a standing reserve for specific projects in case of emergencies and unforeseen priorities.[155] The level of funding required in the Trust Fund is to be determined by the relevant AU policy organs on recommendation by the PSC. The Continental Early Warning System: The Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) is a supporting institution designed to carry out the prevention and early warning mandate of the Peace and Security Council.[156] The CEWS is managed by the Conflict Prevention and Early Warning Unit of the Department of Peace and Security. It consists of two important bodies: the main observation and monitoring centre under the Peace and Security directorate located at the headquarters of the AU (called ‘The Situation Room’); and a communication panel with the observation and monitoring rooms in each of the sub-regional organizations.[157] The Situation Room collects and analyses information from ‘the public domain in hard and soft prints, including newspapers both private and public, satellite TV channels, electronic news sites, and from informal sources on the ground.’[158] The information is then processed and compiled in the form of ‘News Briefs’, and is forwarded to the relevant organs of the AU three times a day and should be posted and circulated through the intranet for all staff of the organization.[159] The Situation Room is linked directly with the observation and monitoring units of the Regional Mechanisms that collect and process data at their level and transmit the same to the Situation Room.[160] The Situation Room also benefits from its collaboration with the United Nations agencies and other international organizations, academic institutions and NGOs.[161] The observation and monitoring is based on an early warning module which contains political, economic, social, military and humanitarian indicators.[162] The CEWS holds periodic and on-demand meetings with the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) on matters of mutual concern. The Panel of the Wise: The Panel of the Wise is an advisory body composed of five highly respected African personalities who have made outstanding contribution to the cause of peace and security on the continent.[163] The Panel was created in 2002, and became operational in 2008. Members of the Panel are appointed by the Assembly for a term of three years. The Panel of the Wise advises the Peace and Security Council and the AU Commission on conflict prevention and promotion of stability in Africa.[164] A body similar to the Panel of the Wise, the OAU’s Commission of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration was established on 21 July 1964, as a tool to support peaceful settlement of disputes between OAU Member States.[165] It was however, non-operational and was replaced in 1993 by the broader Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. No panel was set up under the Mechanism. The Friends of the Panel of the Wise: The Friends of the Panel of the Wise, a team of eminent African personalities from the AU’s five regions, was established in 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of the Panel of the Wise.[166] The Friends of the Panel of the Wise are appointed by the Chairperson of the AU Commission and endorsed by the Assembly. Comprised of outgoing members of the Panel of the Wise, the members are expected to attend all Panel meetings and share the same privileges and entitlements as Panel members. The Pan-African Network of the Wise (PanWise): PanWise was conceived at the June 2012 Ouagadougou Retreat of the Panel of the Wise with regional counterparts.[167] In May 2013, the AU Assembly endorsed the establishment of PanWise in order to bring the Panel of the Wise together with similar regional mechanisms, in a bid to strengthen, coordinate and harmonize the prevention of conflicts and peace keeping efforts under a single umbrella. The core members of PanWise are the AU Panel of the Wise/Friends and their existing and future sub-regional counterparts. They include the Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS’s) Council of the Wise, the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC’s) Mediation Reference Group and Panel of Elders, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa’s (COMESA’s) Committee of Elders; and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development’s (IGAD’s) Mediation Contact Group, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), East African Community (EAC), Arab Maghreb Union (UMA), and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States (CEN–SAD). The associate members of PanWise include the Forum of Former African Heads of State, the Association of African Ombudsmen and Mediators (AAOM), National infrastructures for peace, National mediation councils, and All Africa Council of Churches. The African Standby Force: A key enforcement and supporting institution under the Peace and Security Council is the African Standby Force. The Peace and Security Protocol provides for the establishment of the African Standby Force, composed of a standby arrangement of multi-national and multi-disciplinary civilian, police and military personnel, for the purpose of implementing the peacekeeping and intervention mandate of the AU.[168] Five regional groupings: Central African Standby Force (CASF), Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF), North African Regional Capability (NARC), Southern Africa Standby Force (SASF), and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Standby Force, were envisaged to be fully operational by December 2015.[169] The AU Assembly declared the African Standby Force (ASF) operationally ready in January 2016,[170] but it has not been deployed in its originally designed form. The Peace Support Operations Division, formerly known as the Continental Planning Element of the African Standby Force, was set up to plan, launch, sustain and liquidate peace support operations as authorized by the African Union (AU).[171] The Division also assists in directing and managing such operations. The AU has been involved in several Peace Support Operations (PSOs), either alone or jointly with the United Nations since 2003.[172] African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC): The African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) was established in principle, on an interim basis by the AU Assembly at its May 2013 Summit. ACIRC was established to address the Africa’s rapid response deficit and until ASF and its rapid deployment capability becomes fully operational.[173] The purpose of the ACIRC is to provide the AU with a flexible and robust force, made up of military, police and civilian personnel, and equipment and resources voluntarily provided by willing and capable Member States, to be deployed very rapidly to effectively respond to emergency situations, within the framework of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA).[174] In January 2014, the AU Assembly at its 22nd ordinary session decided to operationalize ACIRC as a transitional arrangement.[175] Twelve Member States volunteered to be the initial participating countries.[176] The volunteering nations have so far conducted three command-post military exercises: November 2014 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, August 2016 in Paradise Valley, Bengo province, Angola and March 2017 at Rwanda Military Academy-Gako, as part of the preparation for readiness of the pledged capabilities. The following proposed committees of the PSC are not yet fully operational: Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD); Sanctions, Counter-Terrorism, Resource Mobilisation; and Procedures and Mechanisms for Peace Support Operations. 4.6. The Pan-African Parliament The AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament (PAP) whose functions, composition and powers are provided for under a separate protocol, the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community Relating to the Pan-African Parliament.[177] The 2001 Protocol is to be replaced upon entry into force of the Protocol to the Constitutive Act of the African Union Relating to the Pan-African Parliament.[178] Adopted by the AU Assembly in 2014, the new Protocol comes into force 30 days after the deposit of instruments of ratification by a simple majority of AU Member States. As at September 2016, 13 Member States have signed the Protocol and 5 have ratified it. The Protocol for the establishment of the PAP provides that Parliamentarians be elected from the Parliament or equivalent legislative organs of each member state.[179] Each Member State of the AU has five Parliamentarians in the PAP selected from both ruling and opposition parties participating in the national parliaments of member States and at least one of whom must be a woman.[180] The tenure of the Parliamentarians in the PAP runs concurrently with their tenure at their national parliament.[181] However, the parliamentarians act and vote independently of their national parliament once they are sworn in the PAP.[182] In its daily activities the PAP is run by a Bureau composed of a president and four vice-presidents elected from all sub-regions based on equitable geographical representation and supported by a Clerk and deputy Clerks .[183] The idea behind the establishment of the PAP is the representation of the African people and their grass-root organizations in the deliberations and decisions of the policy organs of the AU.[184] The PAP is given the mandate to ‘exercise advisory and consultative powers only’ to the Assembly and to all policy organs of the Union either at the request of the AU organs or at its own initiative.[185] In order to carry out its mandate, the PAP is given, inter alia, the power to discuss and make recommendations and pass resolutions on issues of importance and relevance to the continent such as the promotion of peace and security and protection of human rights and democracy.[186] The PAP is also given the mandate to issue invitations to the representatives of policy organs of the Union and member States “to furnish explanations in plenary on issues affecting or likely to affect the life of the African Union.”[187] The members of the PAP are entitled to forward their questions to any policy organ of the AU through the President of the PAP while the President of the PAP can in consultation with the Bureau, invite the Chairperson of the Assembly to explain a decision taken by the Assembly to the PAP.[188] The AU Commission is obliged to submit annual report on the activities of the Union to the PAP.[189] The permanent committees meet at least twice a year in ordinary sessions,[190] while a request for extraordinary session by two-thirds of the PAP members, the Assembly or the Executive Council of the Union can be made at any time.[191] All sessions of the PAP are open for the public unless there is the PAP Bureau decides otherwise.[192] The President of the PAP attends AU Assembly sessions and presents the reports of the PAP to the Assembly.[193] The PAP is operational and sits in South Africa.[194] The PAP budget, including the allowances for its members, is part of the overall AU budget.[195] 4.7. The Court of Justice The Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the Court of Justice of the Union whose statute, composition, and functions are defined in a separate protocol.[196] Identified as the ‘principal judicial organ of the Union’, its statute, composition, and functions were defined in a separate protocol. [197] Although, the Protocol of the Court entered into force in February 2009, 30 days after 15 Member States had ratified it, the Court never became operational. As at 15 June 2017, 44 Member States have signed the 2003 Protocol and 18 have ratified it; the latest ratification on 19 December 2016. In 2008, the AU Assembly merged the Court with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights into a single court, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights. 4.8. The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights (the Court) was not established by the AU Constitutive Act.[198] The initiative for the establishment of the Court started officially with a resolution adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, in June 1994. The Secretary-General was requested to convene a Government legal experts` meeting to deliberate, in conjunction with the African Commission, on how to enhance the efficiency of the African Commission and to consider in particular the establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples Rights.[199] A draft document on an African human rights court was produced by a meeting of experts organized by the OAU Secretariat in collaboration with the African C omission and the International Commission of Jurists, in September 1995.[200] The draft document formed the basis of the first official draft protocol, the Cape Town Draft which was produced a few days later by an OAU meeting of government legal experts.[201] After further elaboration and refining, the Draft Protocol was adopted by the conference of OAU Ministers of Justice/Attorneys General in December 1997.[202] The OAU Council of Ministers adopted the Draft Protocol in February1998, and in June 1998, the 34th ordinary session of the General Assembly adopted and opened the Protocol for signature. The Court was established by the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, (the Protocol).[203] The Court was established to ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights in Africa.[204] The Court complements and reinforces the functions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights.[205] The Court has jurisdiction over all cases and disputes submitted to it concerning the interpretation and application of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, this Protocol and any other relevant human rights instrument ratified by the States concerned.[206] The Court receives complaints and/or applications submitted to it either by the African Commission of Human and Peoples’ Rights or State parties to the Protocol or African Intergovernmental Organizations.[207] Non-Governmental Organizations with observer status before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and individuals can also institute cases directly before the Court, if the State Party involved has made a Declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the Court.[208] As at March 2014, only seven countries have made such a Declaration. The Court is composed of eleven judges who are nationals of Member States of the African Union.[209] The Judges of the Court are elected, after nomination by their respective States, in their individual capacities from among African jurists of proven integrity and of recognized practical, judicial or academic competence and experience in the field of human rights.[210] The judges are elected for a six year or four year term, renewable once.[211] The President and Vice-President of the Court are elected by the judges from among themselves, and serve a two year term. They can be re-elected only once.[212] All the judges, except the President of the Court, work on a part-time basis.[213] The Court officially started its operations in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in November 2006, but in August 2007 it moved to its seat in Arusha, the United Republic of Tanzania. Initially, ‘the Court dealt principally with operational and administrative issues, including the development of the structure of the Court&#39;s Registry, preparation of its budget and drafting of its Interim Rules of Procedure’.[214] The judges adopted the Interim Rules of the Court in 2008. The final Rules of Court was adopted in June 2010, after consultation with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, in order to harmonize the rules of both institutions.[215] The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights remains provisionally in force until the entry into force of the 2008 Protocol and the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights; that is, after 15 Member States have ratified the 2008 Protocol. As at 15 June 2017, 30 states have signed the 2008 Protocol and only 6 have ratified it. 4.9. The African Court of Justice and Human Rights In July 2004, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government decided that the Court of Justice ‘should be integrated into one Court’ with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights citing financial and logistical constraints to establish two different courts.[216] In July 2008, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government adopted the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, merging the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the Court of Justice of the African Union into a single Court, named the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.[217] The Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (Single Protocol) adopted July 2008) is to replace the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights (the old Protocol), and the Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union.[218] The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights is still in operation in spite of its merger with the Court of Justice,[219] because the Protocol and the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights is not yet in force. As at 8 February 2018 only six (6) of the mandatory fifteen (15) Member States have deposited their instruments of ratification. However, according to Justice Sylvain Sore, president of the African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, its mandate will not be usurped by the proposed Single court. The Court will remain separate, obligated to its mandate but as a chamber of the new Court.[220] 4.10. Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) In August 2012, the African Union and Senegal established the Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) within the Senegalese judicial system to “prosecute and try the person(s) most responsible for crimes and serious violations of international law, customary international law and international conventions ratified by Chad, committed on the territory of Chad during the period from 7 June 1982 to 1 December 1990.”[221] The Chambers’ jurisdiction covers genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture,[222] setting a precedent as an internationalized criminal tribunal operating exclusively on the basis of universal jurisdiction. The Court comprises the Investigative/Pre-Trial Chamber, Indictment Chamber, Trial Chamber and Appeals Chamber.[223] Article 11 of the EAC Statute provides that the Chambers shall be composed of two Senegalese judges and two alternate Senegalese judges, and an AU Member State non-Senegalese president, nominated by the Senegalese Minister of Justice and appointed by the Chairperson of the AU Commission.

On April 27, 2017, an appeals court confirmed the verdict. 4.11. The Commission The AU Commission is a permanent organ established by the AU Constitutive Act.[225] The Commission is the administrative wing of the AU accountable to the Assembly and the Executive Council.[226] The AU Commission is given numerous administrative functions and mandate that include administrating the AU institutions; coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU such as Assembly , the Executive Council , the Peace and Security Council of the Union in collaboration with the organs; providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council; initiating proposals on the budget and wide range of regional issues; organizing and managing meetings and accepting donations and grants that are compatible with the objectives and principles of the Union; and depositing the treaties adopted and ratified under the aegis of the African Union.[227] The AU Commission is composed of the Chairperson, the deputy Chairperson and eight Commissioners all of whom are appointed by the Assembly based on gender balance and equitable representation of all sub-regions.[228] Once appointed, all officials of the AU Commission are only responsible to the AU and not to any government and external authority.[229] The officials are assisted by all necessary staff in running the Commission located at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[230] The Chairperson of the Commission is the Chief Executive Officer and legal representative of the AU and is mandated to carry out many essential functions such as the overall responsibility of the finances and administration of the Commission, the preparation of its budget, participating in the meetings of the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and keep records of the deliberations, follow up and report on the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU, appoint staff of the Commission and carry out any function that is assigned to him by the Assembly and the Executive Council.[231] The Chairperson is accountable to the Executive Council.[232] The Deputy Chairperson is accountable to the Chairperson and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Organization.[233] The eight Commissioners are accountable to the Chairperson of the Commission and each Commissioner heads one of the eight departments/directorates of the Commission established along the eight portfolios of the Commission.[234] The portfolios of the Commission are Political Affairs; Peace and Security; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; and Economic Affairs.[235] The Third ordinary session of the Executive Council of the AU maintained the portfolios as departments of the Commission.[236] The Department of Social Affairs oversees two specialized offices: the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN) and the Centre for Linguistic and Historical Studies by Oral Tradition (CELHTO). The Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture oversees the five specialized technical offices: Coordinating Office for the Development Project of the Fouta Djallon Region;[237] African Union-Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR); African Union-Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC); African Union-Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (AU-PATTEC); and the Semi-Arid Food Grain Research and Development (SAFGRAD). It also works with the African Union-Inter-African Phyto-sanitary Council (AU-IAPSC). The Commissioner for Human Resources, Science and Technology oversees the Scientific, Technical and Research Commission (STRC).[238] The Department of Peace and Security is the liaison point for the work of the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism.[239] The Commission consists of directorates and organizational units under the offices of the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission. The Bureau of the Chairperson, the Directorate for Women, Gender and Development; the Directorate for Strategic Policy Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, International Cooperation and Resource Mobilization; the Communication and Information Unit; and Protocol Services Unit; the NEPAD Coordination Unit; the Secretariat of the CSSDCA; the Office of the Legal Counsel; the Office of the Internal Auditor; the Office of the Secretary-General to the Commission; Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO); and the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) are under the office of the Chairperson.[240] The Directorate for Administration and Human Resources Development; the Directorate for Programming, Budgeting, Finance and Accounting; the Medical Services Directorate; and the Directorate for Conference Services are under the Office of the Deputy Chairperson.[241] The self-funding Technical Committee of Experts for the Implementation of the Diaspora Legacy Projects was established in 2013 by the Assembly. The Committee is composed of the heads or representatives of the following institutions and sectors: AU Commission; New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA); African Development Bank (AfDB); United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); Regional Economic Communities (RECs); Africa Capacity Building Institute; the private sector; African Diaspora; and implementing agencies.[242] The Technical Committee of Experts is to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the Five Legacy Projects that were adopted at the Global African Diaspora Summit in May 2012, and endorsed by the Assembly in July 2012.[243] 4.12. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council The AU Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) is an advisory body composed of representatives of civil society, professional groups and cultural groups both in Africa and in the Diaspora.[244] The main idea behind the establishment of the ECOSOCC is the broad participation of the ordinary African citizens through representative civil society organizations and professional groups in the activities of the Union.[245] Thus, the main objectives of the ECOSOCC include the participation of the African Civil Society in the promulgation and implementation of the policies and norms of the AU and the development of communication between the ordinary citizens of Africa on common issues of the continent.[246] Based on its objectives, the ECOSOCC is given the task of popularization of the AU norms among the citizens of Africa and giving advisory services to the organs of the Union how best to implement the norms and policies of the Organization at its own initiative or at the request of organs of the Union.[247] The structures of the ECOSOCC include its General Assembly; an 18 member Standing Committee; 10 Sectoral Cluster Committees; and Credentials Committee.[248] The General Assembly is the highest decision making organ[249] with 150 civil society organizations (CSOs) at the level of member states, sub-regions, the continent, the African diaspora and ex-officio members appointed by the Commission.[250] The election of member states, regional, continental and Diaspora representatives is based on 50 percent gender equality and 50 percent aged between 18 and 35. Members are elected for four-year terms and may be re-elected once.[251] The Standing Committee appointed by the General Assembly coordinates the work of ECOSOCC, while the Sectoral Cluster Committees advise on the following areas: Peace and Security; Political Affairs; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs and Health; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; Economic Affairs; Women and Gender; and Cross-Cutting Programmes (such as HIV/AIDS, international cooperation and coordination with other AU institutions and organs).[252] The Credentials Committee is responsible for examining the credentials of ECOSOCC members and their representatives.[253] The Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) office in the AU Commission acts as the Secretariat for ECOSOCC, pending arrangements for the relocation of the Secretariat to Zambia.[254] The AU ECOSOCC was launched on March 27-30, 2005 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at the headquarters of the AU.[255] During the launching conference, the Interim General Assembly of the ECOSOCC swore in the late Wangari Maathai, Nobel Laureate from Kenya, as the President of the Bureau of the Interim General Assembly of ECOSOCC with four deputies from the centre, north, south and west sub-regions.[256] The mandate of the first ECOSOCC General Assembly session launched on, 9 September 2008, expired in September 2012. The second permanent General Assembly of ECOSOCC was inaugurated on 22 December 2014 in Nairobi, Kenya.[257] Its mandate ends in December 2018.[258] In January 2016, the Assembly adopted ECOSOCC’s Rules of Procedure.[259] 4.13. The Financial Institutions The Constitutive Act of the AU envisaged the establishment of the African Central Bank, the African Monetary Fund and the African Investment Bank as the three new financial institutions under the Union.[260] The rules and regulations for the establishment of the African Central Bank are yet to be provided in a separate protocol. The fourth ordinary session of the AU Assembly requested the Chairperson of the Commission to prepare the legal instruments for the establishment of the three financial institutions.[261] The Assembly session also decided that the African Central Bank should be located in the Western sub-region while the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund should be located in the Northern and Central sub-regions respectively.[262] Accordingly Nigeria was selected as the host country for the future African Central Bank while Libya and Cameroon were chosen to host the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund respectively.[263] A flagship programme of the AUC Agenda 2063, the African Central Bank is a joint project in collaboration with the Bureau of the African Central Bank Association (AACB). The implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Strategy on the establishment of the African Central Bank is expected to start in 2018.[264] 4.13.1. The African Monetary Fund On 27 June 2014, the AU Assembly at its 23rd ordinary session adopted the Protocol and the Statute for the establishment of the African Monetary Fund (AMF); with an initial capital of 22.64 billion dollars.[265] The Protocol and the Statute shall enter into force on ratification by 15 of the 54 of the Member States of the African Union and the payment of at least 25 per cent of the minimum paid-up capital.[266] As at 8 February 2018, 10 Member States have signed the Protocol but none has ratified it. The purpose of the Fund is to foster macroeconomic stability, sustainable shared economic growth and balanced development in the continent, in order to facilitate the effective and predictable integration of African economies.[267] The objectives of the African Monetary Fund are to provide financial assistance to AU Member States; act as a clearing house as well as undertake macro-economic purveyance within the continent; co-ordinate the monetary policies of Member States and promote cooperation between the monetary authorities in these states; and encourage capital movements between member states.[268] The functions and activities of the Fund include promoting and facilitating trade, the settlement of commercial payment and encouraging capital flow between State Parties; providing short-term and medium-term credit facilities to sustain balance of payment and providing technical assistance and policy advice, to States Parties; with a view to assisting in financing their overall balance of payments deficits.[269] The agreed timeframe under Agenda 2063 for establishing the AMF is 2023.[270] The Headquarters of the African Monetary Fund is to be in Yaoundé, Republic of Cameroon.[271] 4.13.2. The African Investment Bank On 4th February 2009, the AU Assembly at its 12th ordinary session adopted the Protocol on the African Investment Bank and the Statute annexed to it.[272] The Annexes to the Statutes of the African Investment Bank were adopted on 2nd February 2010 at the 14th ordinary session of the Assembly.[273] The Protocol shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the Protocol.[274] As at 15 June 2017, 22 member states have signed the Protocol and 5 have ratified it. The Statute of the African Investment Bank shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification.[275] The agreed timeframe under Agenda 2063 for establishing the AIB was 2016, but as at 15 June 2017, 22 Member States have signed the Protocol and only 5 have ratified it. The purpose of the Bank is to foster economic integration and development in line with the objectives of the Union.[276] The objectives of the Bank are to promote investment activities of the public and private sector intended to advance regional integration of the Member States of the African Union; utilize available resources for the implementation of investment projects contributing to strengthening the private sector and modernization of rural sector activities and infrastructures; mobilize resources from capital markets inside and outside Africa for the financing of investment projects in African countries; and provide technical assistance as may be needed in African countries for the study, preparation, financing and execution of investment projects.[277] The Headquarters of the Bank will be in Tripoli, Libya.[278] 4.14. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights forms part of the African regional system of human rights, which has its basis on the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[279] The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights established the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as an organ of implementation of its substantive provisions.[280] The AU Constitutive Act does not recognize the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one of the organs of the AU. However, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights was incorporated as an organ of the AU in 2002.[281] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is composed of eleven members elected by the AU Executive Committee from member States and appointed by the AU Assembly.[282] The members of the Commission serve in their personal capacity.[283] The Commission is run by a Secretariat in its daily activities.[284] The budget of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is provided by the AU as part of the overall budget of the AU Commission.[285] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given three mandates: promotional, protective and interpretative.[286] Under the promotional mandate, the Commission works for the awareness of human rights in Africa through different methods such as publication, research on human rights problems in Africa and collaboration with African and other international institutions concerned with the protection of human and peoples’ rights.[287] The protective mandate of the Commission generally provides that the Commission shall ‘ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter.’[288] Under the protective mandate, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights examine State reports, inter-state communications, and in limited cases, individual complaints of human rights violations. [289] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given the general power to ‘resort to any appropriate method of investigation’ thereby giving it some latitude to adopt investigation methods within the bounds of its protective mandate.[290] Consequently, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has developed other important protective functions over the years. The use of fact-finding missions in member States and the appointment of Special Rapporteur on thematic issues of human rights on the continent are the two main protective functions undertaken by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[291] All the above-mentioned protective measures of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights result in reports and recommendations which are communicated to the concerned State parties and to the Assembly of the AU.[292] The AU Assembly may request the Commission to make further in-depth investigation if it believes that the report of the Commission indicates serious human rights violations.[293] Any measure that may be taken by the Commission within its protective mandate remains confidential until the AU Assembly decides otherwise.[294] 5. Other Bodies Related to the African Union 5.1. Committee of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa (CISSA) CISSA was established on 26 August 2004 in Abuja, Nigeria, by the Heads of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa. It was endorsed at the 4th ordinary session of AU Assembly in Abuja, in January 2005.[295] CISSA is envisaged to provide leadership on intelligence and security matters in furtherance of peace, security and stability in Africa. It does so by facilitating dialogue, study, analysis, consultation, coordination and adoption of common strategies towards common security challenges among Intelligence and Security Organizations in Africa. CISSA has three permanent bodies: the Conference, composed of Heads of Intelligence and Security Services of Member States; the Panel of Experts (PoE), comprising the representatives from each member of CISSA; and the Secretariat, which is based in Addis Ababa for easy coordination with the African Union.

PAU’s objectives include: developing continent-wide and world-class graduate and postgraduate programmes in science, technology, innovation, humanities and social sciences and governance; stimulating collaborative, internationally competitive, leading edge fundamental and economic growth-oriented research; and enhancing the mobility of students and academic staff among African universities to improve teaching and collaborative research.[366] Article 14 of the PAU Statute provides for the establishment of an endowment fund based on voluntary contributions from AU Member States, Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and AU partners. PAU is designed to operate in a series of thematic hubs in five geographic sub-regions.[367] The five thematic areas are: Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya; Life and Earth Sciences, including Health and Agriculture at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria; Governance, Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Yaoundé II, and the University of Buea, Cameroon; Water and Energy Sciences, including climate change, at the University of Tlemcen, Algeria. The Space Sciences is to be based in Southern Africa, with a yet to be identified host institution. The Revised Statutes of the Pan African University provides for five PAU management organs: the PAU Council, the Rectorate, Directorates of Institutes, Boards of Institutes, and the PAU Senate.[368] The Rector of the PAU is equivalent in rank to the Vice Chancellor of the host University housing the PAU Institute. Cameroon is the host country of PAU’s Rectorate.[369] 5.4.15. African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency The AU Assembly at its 19th ordinary session in Addis Ababa in July 2012 endorsed in principle the proposal to establish a financial entity, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency.[370] The Agreement for the Establishment of the African Risk Capacity has entered into force.[371] The objective of the ARC Agency is to assist the Member states to reduce the risk of loss and damage caused by extreme weather events and natural disasters therefore protecting the food security of their vulnerable populations.[372] The ARC Agency uses Africa RiskView, an advanced satellite weather surveillance and software, developed by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), to estimate and trigger readily available funds to African countries hit by severe weather events.[373] The organs of the ARC Agency are the Conference of the Parties; the Governing Board; and the Secretariat.[374] The Conference of the Parties is composed of all Parties to the Agreement, represented by Ministers or authorized representatives.[375] The quorum for a Conference of the Parties shall be a simple majority of the Parties of the ARC Agency.[376] The Governing Board is composed of five (5) members, and one (1) alternate for each such member.[377] The Secretariat is currently headed by the first African General Manager.[378] The ARC Agency is based in Johannesburg, South Africa.[379] 5.4.16. Pan African Intellectual Property Organisation (PAIPO) In January 2013, the AU Assembly at its 20th ordinary summit in Addis Ababa agreed to establish the Pan African Intellectual Property Organization (PAIPO).[380] The creation of PAIPO was first proposed at the 5th ordinary session of the African Union Conference of Ministers in charge of Science and Technology (AMCOST V) held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, from 12 to 15 November 2012.[381] The creation of PAIPO is in recognition of the need to address the continued need to promote creativity and utilization of the Intellectual Property system amongst Member States.[382] Tunisia has offered to host PAIPO.[383] PAIPO is scheduled to begin operations in 2018 and be fully functional by 2023.[384] Its Statute was adopted in January 2016[385] and will enter into force 30 days after 15 Member States have ratified it.[386] As at 8 February, 2018, 3 member states have signed the Statute but none has ratified it. PAIPO will be composed of a Conference of States Parties, Council of Ministers, Secretariat and Board of Appeal, [387] and will be based in Tunisia.[388] 6. The Relation Between the AU and Sub-Regional Organizations Currently there are over ten sub-regional organizations in Africa. The African Union initially recognized eight sub-regional organizations: Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Common Market of East and Southern Africa (COMESA), Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD), Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), Economic Community of Sahelo-Saharian States (CEN-SAD) and East African Community (EAC).[389] The AU has recognized two additional sub-regional organizations: the East African Stand-by Force Command (EASFCOM) and the North African Regional Capability (NARC).[390] The African sub-regional organizations were initially established as economic communities in their respective sub-region. There is no clear framework to coordinate the economic objectives of the AU with the sub-regional organizations. Moreover, the major sub-regional organizations have developed norms and institutions on security. In this regard, the Peace and Security Council Protocol provides that the sub-regional organizations are part and parcel of the continental security architecture.[391] The African Common Defense and Security Policy reaffirms that sub-regional organizations are the implementing institutions of the AU norms on the prevention, management and resolution of conflict under the umbrella of the Peace and Security Council.[392] In January 2008, the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation on Peace and Security between the AU and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs)/ Regional Mechanisms (RMs) for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was concluded in Addis Ababa.[393] All REC/RMs have signed the MOU. The last to do so was the North African Regional Capability (NARC), in September 2011. In the framework of this MOU, the parties hold regular meetings, joint missions and consultations, inter alia, working together to make the African Standby Force (ASF) fully operational. 7. The Status of the AU Under the UN Charter The UN Charter provides the following characteristics of regional organizations under Article 52(1): Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided that such arrangement or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations. The words ‘agencies’ or ‘arrangements’ under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter refer to the kind of regional organisation that member States may establish.[394] Thus, ‘arrangements’ are organisations based on multilateral treaties among States while ‘agencies’ refer to regional organisations with various kinds of organs of implementation of the multilateral treaties.[395] The criteria for determining whether an organisation is a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter are two: [396] 1) The organisation should play a role in the maintenance of international peace and security as is appropriate for regional action. 2) The objectives of organisation and its activities should be compatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. When seen against the above criteria, the AU can be characterised as a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter as it is meant to play a role in the maintenance of peace and security in Africa[397] and observe the purposes and principles of the UN.[398] Moreover, the Protocol for the establishment of the AU Peace and Security Council as well as the various statements of the AU organs indicate that the AU considers itself as a regional organization within the meaning of Article 52(1) of the UN Charter.[399] For instance, in its 10th ordinary session, the AU Assembly called upon the UN ‘to examine, within the context of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, the possibility of funding, through assessed contributions, peacekeeping operations undertaken by African Union or under its authority and with the consent of the United Nations.’[400] In its various communications, the UN Security Council has also recognised the AU as a regional organisation within the parameter of the principles laid down in Articles 52 and 53 of the UN Charter. [401] 8. The Status of the AU Treaties The transformation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) into the new continental organization of the AU in 2001 makes it necessary to discuss the current status of the treaties that were signed and ratified under the aegis of the OAU. Currently there are 61 treaties under the auspices of the African Union, and 30 of these treaties have entered into force. Note that the above information may not be correct as not all OAU/AU Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and Charters are listed in the AU website.[402] About 33 per cent of these treaties were adopted under the auspices of OAU, the predecessor of the AU. The treaties adopted under the OAU are assumed by the AU and continue to be binding on those States, which have signed and ratified them. 9.

This is the case with the United Nations Charter where some countries have withdrawn notwithstanding that it is not mentioned textually. Libya’s proposal is that this right should not be mentioned in the Act, as if states are being invited to withdraw or denounce the Act’. In the text of the same document of the proposed amendment under Article 31, Libya went further than its explanatory notes and stated that Article 31 should be deleted because ‘a state whose policy-making bodies have ratified the Constitutive Act has no grounds to withdraw from the Union, renounce its membership and request that the Act should cease to apply to it.’ [32] Constitutive Act (n 17) preamble paragraph 1 provides that member States are ‘inspired by the noble ideals which guided the founding fathers of our Continental Organisation OAU and generations of Pan-Africanists in their determination to promote unity, solidarity, cohesion and cooperation among the peoples of Africa and African States’.

Background: The Transformation of the OAU into the AU 1.1. The OAU The Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union, was established by the then independent states of Africa on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[1] The OAU Charter served as a roadmap for the efforts and actions of the independent African States to liberate the continent from colonialism and apartheid. By the end of the 1970s, much of Africa was liberated from colonialism with the exception of the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe. This new reality in Africa led to the call for the review of the OAU Charter as early as 1979. The sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held in Monrovia, Liberia, in July 1979 established the OAU Charter Review Committee (the Committee) in a bid “to re-examine the provisions of the Charter in light of the changes and realities in Africa.”[2] The Committee was meant to make a detailed study of the OAU Charter in light of the current needs of the continent and come up with specific proposals for new norms and institutions that would have been instrumental in responding to the atrocities like the Rwandan genocide. The Committee attempted to forward a proposal for new rules and institutions that would make the Charter more effective.[3] Nevertheless, the activities of the Committee were very slow and highly marginalised because of the absence of active involvement of member States. New developments on the continent and worldwide, such as the total liberation of African States from colonialism, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the challenges of massive human rights violations inside independent African States and intra-state and inter-state conflicts and the end of the cold war made the transformation of the OAU a necessity. 1.2. The Sirte Declaration and the Establishment of the African Union By July 1999, when the OAU Thirty-Fifth Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Algiers, it was clear that the OAU Charter Review Committee had failed to achieve its purpose. The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government accepted a call for an extraordinary meeting on the issue of the transformation of the OAU[4] and decided to hold its 4th extraordinary meeting ‘to discuss ways and means of making the OAU effective so as to keep pace with political and economic developments taking place in the world and the preparation required of Africa within the context of globalization so as to preserve its socio-economic and political potentials.[5] Accordingly, the fourth extraordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Sirte, Libya on 8-9 September 1999 and adopted the Sirte Declaration, which inter alia called for the establishment of the African Union: Article 8: “Having discussed frankly and extensively on how to proceed with the strengthening of the unity of our continent and its peoples, in the light of those proposals, and bearing in mind the current situation on the Continent, we decide to: (i) Establish an African Union, in conformity with the ultimate objectives of the Charter of our Continental Organization and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.”[6] The Sirte Declaration did not specify the details of the new organisation. Rather the Declaration instructed the Council of Ministers and the Secretary-General of the OAU to work on the details of the establishment of the new organisation (African Union) and report their work to the next ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.[7] Accordingly, the OAU Secretary-General established a Departmental Task Force under the Chairmanship of the OAU Assistant-Secretary General for Political Affairs to design the steps that should be taken by the OAU Secretariat to implement the Sirte Declaration.[8] The Departmental Task force recommended involvement of expert consultants to develop the preparatory documents for the Constitutive Act of the African Union in collaboration with the OAU Secretariat.[9] In February 2000, a group of consultants with backgrounds in law, economics and politics met in Addis Ababa and came up with a draft Constitutive Act of the African Union.[10] After consultation by the OAU Secretariat with member states, the draft Constitutive Act together with earlier draft proposals from member states were presented to two consecutive meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians on the establishment of the African Union that were held on 17-20 April 2000 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and 27-29 May 2000 in Tripoli, Libya respectively.[11] The meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and presented their assessment to a Ministerial Conference on the Establishment of the African Union on 31 May - 2 June 2000 in Tripoli, Libya. The Ministerial Conference reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and decided to establish a working group to further elaborate on the draft Constitutive Act.[12] The working group submitted the revised draft Constitutive Act to the Seventy-second ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers on 6-8 July 2000 in Lomé, Togo.[13] After further deliberations, the OAU Council of Ministers approved the draft Constitutive Act and recommended its submission to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government for adoption.[14] The thirty-sixth ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of the Heads of State and Government held in Lomé, Togo on 10-12 July 2000 adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union and urged member states of the OAU to ratify the Constitutive Act as soon as possible.[15] The fifth extraordinary meeting of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government declared the political birth of the African Union and noted that the Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) would enter in to force 30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification by two-thirds of the member States of the OAU, as provided for in Article 28 of the Constitutive Act.[16] The Constitutive Act entered into force on 26 May 2001 upon ratification by two thirds of member States of the OAU replacing the OAU Charter.[17] The African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held its inaugural session in Durban, South Africa, on 9 July 2002.[18] 2. Membership of the African Union There are three requirements for membership in the African Union (AU). First, a State should be an African State.[19] Second, a simple majority of member states supports the application for membership,[20] and third, the African State should sign and ratify the AU Constitutive Act.[21] “After withdrawing in 1984 from the OAU, the predecessor of the AU, Morocco re-joined the AU as its 55th member on 20 January 2017.”[22] Several countries have at various times been suspended from membership of the AU. Suspension is the AU’s usual response to any interruption of constitutional rule by a member.[23] The Assembly also recognises representatives of the African Diaspora,[24] and passed a Resolution inviting its representatives as observers to Assembly sessions.[25] Haiti was granted Observer Status on 2 February 2012 and its request to become an associate member was denied on 17 May 2016. The AU emphasized that according to its statutes only African states can join the African Union.[26] There are no criteria set in the Constitutive Act as standards for the vote on the request for accession. Moreover, all AU member States have the same rights and obligations. The Constitutive Act does not provide for a veto power or any kind of special status for any member State of the AU. Withdrawal of membership is allowed after a member State notifies in writing its intention to renounce its membership of the Union to the Chairperson of the AU Commission, who will communicate such notification to the other State parties of the Constitutive Act.[27] The applicant should wait one year from the date of notification of its intention to renounce membership before its rights and obligations under the Constitutive Act are terminated.[28] The rights and obligations of the Member State remain intact during the one year window period.[29] After a window period of one year, the applicant is deemed to have withdrawn its membership if it does not rescind its decision to renounce its membership. Article 12 of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act provides for the repeal of the right to renounce membership.[30] The explanatory notes accompanying the proposal for the removal of the right recognizes that renunciation of membership is the right of member States but nevertheless argues for the deletion of the right as it has a negative connotation on the unity of the region.[31] 3. The Objectives and Principles of the African Union Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitutive Act of the AU enumerate the objectives and principles of the regional organization. The objectives and principles can be summarized into the following six interrelated areas. The first three sub-sections focus on the objectives while the last three focus on explaining the principles that are meant to be used to achieve the objectives. 3.1. Regional Integration The AU is planned to be a forum for the promotion of regional integration and African unity through socio-economic integration, continental research on all fields including science and technology and the development of common positions on issues of common interest.[32] The AU also establishes institutions that nurture solidarity among African peoples, coordinate its actions with sub-regional economic communities and forges a common front in international negotiations and cooperation.[33] 3.2. Peace and Security The AU member States recognize that ‘the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent.’[34] Thus, one important objective area of the AU is the establishment of collective security system in a bid to promote peace and security as a prerequisite for development on the continent.[35] The focus on peace and security can also be gathered from the new norms and institutions of collective security that member States established.[36] AU member States pledge to strengthen and provide necessary mandate and resources to all relevant institutions including institutions for the maintenance of collective security.[37] 3.3. Protection of Human Rights The protection of human rights is provided as one major objective for the establishment of the AU. One reason given by member States for establishing the AU is their determination ‘to promote and protect human and peoples’ rights, consolidate democratic institutions and culture, and to ensure good governance and the rule of law.’[38] Thus, the AU member States set the observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one objective of the organization.[39] Moreover, the promotion of ‘democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance’ is provided as an objective of the organization within the promotion and protection of the rights of African people. [40] 3.4. Non-Intervention The AU Constitutive Act rules out unilateral intervention between member States. Unilateral intervention among member States is pointed out as a common security threat on the continent.[41] Apart from the direct principle of ‘non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another,’[42] the non-intervention norm is expressed through many principles of the organisation. For instance, the Constitutive Act rejects subversive activities in member States.[43] Subversion is defined as constituting ‘any act that incites, aggravates or creates dissension within or among Member States with the intention or purpose to destabilize or overthrow the existing regime or political order by, among other means, fomenting racial, religious, linguistic, ethnic and other differences’ in violation of the Constitutive Act and the Charter of the United Nations.[44] Thus, subversion does not only include the use or threat of military force, which is prohibited under the Constitutive Act,[45] but also the non-military means of interference.[46] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the AU proposes two additional principles on subversion that request ‘restraint by any Member State from entering into any treaty or alliance that is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the Union’ and prohibit ‘any Member State from allowing the use of its territory as a base for subversion against another Member State.’[47] The AU non-intervention principle is based on the principles of sovereign equality and interdependence among member States and respect of borders existing on achievement of independence.[48] The principles of ‘peaceful co-existence of Member States and their right to live in peace and security’ and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among member States are also the basis of the non-intervention norm among member States of the AU. [49] 3.5. Intervention Intervention in member States under the AU constitutes an unprecedented principle under international law. The AU is endowed with the right to intervene ‘in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.’[50] The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union adds ‘a serious threat to legitimate order to restore peace and stability to the Member State of the Union’ as an additional element that would trigger intervention by the AU in a member State as well as crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.[51] AU member States have also agreed on the right to ‘request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and security.’[52] This is a case of intervention by invitation. The request for intervention from a member State is made to the Assembly of the AU, which is the highest decision-making organ.[53] 3.6. Respect for Democracy and Rule of Law AU member States have acknowledged the relation between democracy, rule of law and economic development. The principles of respect for democracy, rule of law, and good governance are adopted as precondition for social justice that ensures economic development in member States of the AU.[54] The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (a.k.a NEPAD) is one framework launched by African States that links the respect for civil and political rights with the right to development in member States of the AU.[55] AU member States adopted the principle of ‘condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of governments.’[56] The rejection of impunity is also a principle adopted by the AU member States that strengthen their commitment to the rule of law.[57] 4. The Institutions of the African Union Article 5 of the AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the following institutions of the Union: the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Specialized Technical Committees, the Pan-African Parliament, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights,[58] the Financial Institutions, the Commission, the Permanent Representatives Committee, and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council.[59] Another key institution, which was not directly established by the Constitutive Act, is the AU Peace and Security Council. A brief exposition based on the Constitutive Act and respective protocols of the institution follows. 4.1. The Assembly The AU Assembly is the supreme decision-making organ of the Union.[60] It is composed of the Heads of State and Government of all member States of the African Union or their accredited representatives.[61] The Assembly meets at least once in a year in an ordinary session and convenes for an extra ordinary meeting at the request of a member State and upon the approval of two-third majority of member States.[62] In its 2004 summit the AU Assembly decided to meet twice a year in ordinary session citing its increasing responsibilities in the face of the many challenges of the continent.[63] All the sessions of the Assembly are to be held at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[64] However, the Assembly can hold its session elsewhere if a member State extends invitation to host the session. The inviting State should not be under sanction from the AU and should be able to meet pre-determined criteria such as paying up all financial obligations to the Union and maintaining favourable political atmosphere.[65] The Assembly should hold at least one session at the headquarters of the Union every other year based on its calendar.[66] As a matter of rule all sessions of the Assembly are closed.[67] However, the Assembly may decide to hold open sessions with a vote of simple majority.[68] The decisions of the Assembly are made either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority of the member States of the Union.[69] The Assembly is led by a Chairperson elected among the heads of State or government for a period of one year.[70] The Chairperson of the Assembly is generally elected after consultations among member States and based on the principle of rotation.[71] However, as an exception to the rule, the head of state or government of a host country which has invited the Assembly for its proceedings is given the automatic right to be the Chairperson of the Assembly.[72] The Chairperson of the Assembly is assisted by the Bureau for each summit composed of fourteen Vice-Chairpersons elected based on geographical distribution and due consultations.[73] The Chairperson is responsible, inter alia, to convene the sessions of the Assembly, guide the proceedings of the Assembly, rule on point of order and in consultation with the Chairperson of the Commission represents the Union in between sessions.[74] As the supreme organ of the Union, the Assembly determines the policies of all organs of the Union.[75] It monitors the implementation of policies and decisions by its organs and takes decisions on reports and recommendations from its organs such as a recommendation for intervention in member States from the Peace and Security Council.[76] In particular the Assembly directs the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and the Commission on management of conflicts, acts of terrorism and emergency situations.[77] The Assembly is mandated to impose sanctions on member States for violation of the principles enshrined in the Constitutive Act.[78] Moreover, the Assembly adopts the budget of the Union and appoints and removes the judges to both the African Human Rights Court and the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, when operational.[79] The structure, functions and regulations of the AU Commission,[80] the administrative wing of the organization, is determined by the Assembly.[81] The Assembly appoints the Chairperson of the Commission and his/her deputies as well as all other Commissioners of the Union and determines their functions and terms of office.[82] The Assembly is also given power of interpretation of the Constitutive Act until the establishment of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.[83] The Assembly has the right to delegate its powers and functions to any organ of the AU.[84] The Assembly delegated its powers to the Peace and Security Council (PSC), the standing decision-making organ for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in 2004.[85] The Assembly recently established the High-Level Committee of Heads of State and Government on the Post-2015 Development Agenda[86] and the High-Level Panel on Alternative Sources of Financing.[87] Another important innovation of the AU is Agenda 2063. Adopted by the Heads of State and Governments of the AU during the 24th Ordinary Assembly held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 30-31 January 2015, Agenda 2063 ‘is a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years’. Its builds on, and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development, such as the Lagos Plan of Action, The Abuja Treaty, The Minimum Integration Programme, the Programme for Infrastructural Development in Africa (PIDA), the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), The New partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), Regional Plans and Programmes and National Plans. It is also built on national, regional, continental best practices in its formulation.[88] 4.2. The Executive Council The Executive Council is another decision-making organ composed of the ministers of foreign affairs or equivalent authorities designated by the governments of the member States of the AU.[89] The Executive Council is directly accountable to the Assembly.[90] The details of most decisions and policies of the Assembly of the Union are worked out by the Council before they are presented to the Assembly for final decision.[91] The Executive Council has the power to make its own binding decisions on common interest of member States such as foreign trade, energy, transport and communication, education, culture, health, and immigration.[92] The Executive Council can also make binding decisions in other areas based on the powers delegated to it by the Assembly.[93] The Executive Council has three Sub-Committees which operate at ministerial level.[94] The Ministerial Committee on Candidatures is responsible for promoting African candidates for positions in international bodies; the Ad-Hoc Ministerial Committee on the Review of Scale of Assessment is responsible for reviewing the scale of assessment for Member State contributions to the AU budget;[95] and the Ministerial Committee on the Challenges of Ratification/Accession and Implementation of the OAU/AU Treaties.[96] The Executive Council meets at least twice a year in ordinary sessions while extraordinary meetings can be held when a member state requires and two-thirds of the member States support the request.[97] In practice, the Executive Council holds its meetings immediately before every session of the AU Assembly. The meeting of the Executive Council is chaired by the Minister of Foreign Affairs or equivalent authority whose country holds the Chair of the Assembly or in case of extraordinary session the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the host member State.[98] As a rule all sessions of the Executive Council are closed unless the Council decides by simple majority to hold open meetings. [99] The Executive Council makes its decisions by consensus or, failing which, by a two-thirds majority of the member States.[100] The Executive Council is assisted by the Permanent Representative Committee[101] and the seven Specialized Technical Committees of the AU. 4.3. The Specialized Technical Committees The Specialized Technical Committees are various committees responsible for, inter alia, the preparation and coordination of the projects and programs of the Union and supervision and follow-up of the policies of the Union or any function assigned by the Executive Council.[102] The Specialized Committees are accountable to the Executive Council.[103] The Committees are composed of ministers or senior officials of member States responsible for rural economy and agriculture; monetary and financial affairs; trade, customs and immigration matters; industry, science and technology, energy, natural resources and environment; transport, communications and tourism; Health, Labour and Social Affairs; and Education, Culture and Human Resources.[104] The Assembly has the mandate to add other relevant committees or reorganize the existing Specialized Committees as it deems fit.[105] The Specialized Technical Committees meet as often as required by their tasks or as directed by the Executive Council.[106] 4.4. The Permanent Representatives Committee The Permanent Representative Committee (PRC) is a body composed of permanent representatives of member States to the AU resident at the Headquarters of the Union in Addis Ababa or other duly accredited plenipotentiaries of member States.[107] The PRC is accountable to the Executive Council.[108] The PRC serves as an advisory body to Executive Council.[109] The PRC prepares the bulk of the work of the Executive Council, carrying out most of the practical activities for the Executive Council including the preparation and recommendation of agendas for the sessions of the Executive Council and drafting proposals for decisions of the Executive Council.[110] The PRC monitors the implementation of the budget of the Union and the decisions of the Executive Council.[111] The Executive Council can assign more functions to the PRC.[112] The PRC can establish ad-hoc committees and working groups to carry out its tasks. The PRC has eleven (11) sub-Committees on: Administrative, Budgetary and Financial Matters; Audit Matters; Contributions; Economic and Trade Matters; Headquarters and Host Agreements; Multilateral Cooperation and Strategic Partnerships; New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); Programmes and Conferences; Refugees; Structures; and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine Relief in Africa,[113] and Rules, Standards and Credentials.[114] The PRC is also the organ that facilitates the communication between the Commission of the AU and member States.[115] The PRC holds its sessions at the headquarters of the AU at least once in a month chaired by the Permanent Representative whose country holds the chair of the Executive Council.[116] All the sessions of the PRC are closed unless the PRC decides by simple majority to hold open meetings.[117] 4.5. The Peace and Security Council The Peace and Security Council with its supporting institutions is the main pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture (ASPA). The ASPA is the umbrella term for the key AU mechanisms for promoting peace, security and stability in the African continent.[118] 4.5.1. Establishment The Protocol on the Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union[119] established the Peace and Security Council as one the organs of the AU in accordance with article 5 (2) of the Constitutive Act.[120] In the initial process of establishing the AU, the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was incorporated and retained as a peace and security organ of the AU based on Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act.[121] Following the incorporation of the Central Organ, the OAU Assembly requested the OAU Secretary-General to undertake a review of the structures, procedures and working methods of the Central Organ of the 1993 OAU Mechanism, including the possibility of changing its name.[122] The OAU Secretary-General presented his report and the draft protocol for the establishment of a new Peace and Security Council to the OAU Council of Ministers in July 2002 during the transition from OAU to the AU.[123] The draft protocol was presented to the first ordinary session of the Assembly of African Union held in Durban, South Africa. The Protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council was adopted by the first ordinary session of the AU Assembly and entered into force on 26 December 2003.[124] The Peace and Security Council is a permanent decision-making organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa established on the basis of Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act of the AU.[125] The Peace and Security Council is situated at the Headquarters of the African Union.[126] 4.5.2. Composition The 15 member States of the Peace and Security Council are elected by the AU Executive Council and endorsed by the AU Assembly. The election is based on the principles of equitable regional representation and national rotation, with three members from the centre, three members from the east, two members from the north, three members from the south and four members from the west of Africa.[127] There is no provision for permanent and non-permanent members of the Peace and Security Council.[128] However, the Peace and Security Council Protocol has provided detailed criteria for membership of States to the Council. The Peace and Security Council Protocol requires that prospective member States to the Peace and Security Council should exhibit, inter alia, respect for constitutional governance, the rule of law, the protection of human rights and the commitment to honour financial obligations of the Union.[129] Any AU member State that meets the criteria may apply for membership to the Peace and Security Council.[130] Initial election on the candidacy is preferably done by each sub-region of Africa which would later submit the candidates to the AU Assembly, the organ which makes the final selection.[131] The first members of the Peace and Security Council were elected by the Executive Council as delegated by the Assembly.[132] The Peace and Security Council Protocol also provides that the Assembly shall conduct a periodic review to assess the extent to which elected members of the Council continue to meet the membership criteria and ‘take action as appropriate’.[133] The phrase ‘take action as appropriate’ refers to the possibility of dismissal of a member State from the Peace and Security Council when it fails to fulfil the criteria of membership specified under Article 5(2) of the Peace and Security Council Protocol. 4.5.3. Subsidiary Bodies The PSC established two subsidiary bodies: the Committee of Experts and the Military Staff Committee, as authorized by its Protocol. The following proposed committees of the PSC: the Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD); Sanctions, Counter-Terrorism, Resource Mobilization; and Procedures and Mechanisms for Peace Support Operations are not yet operational. The Committee of Experts: The Committee of Experts was established to assist PSC prepare its draft decisions.[134] The Committee comprises of a designated expert representing each PSC Member State and the Peace and Security Department expert officers. The Committee meets before each PSC meeting. The Military Staff Committee: The Military Staff Committee (MSC) is a standing advisory body to the Peace and Security Council on military and related security matters.[135] The MSC is composed of Senior Military Officers of members of the Peace and Security Council.[136] However, the MSC can also meet at the level of Chiefs of Defence Staff of members of the Peace and Security Council.[137] The MSC members meet as often as required, and at least once in a month.[138] Even though the MSC is directly accountable to the Peace and Security Council, it can also consult with other relevant organs of the AU.[139] The meetings of the MSC follow the Rules of Procedure provided under the Policy Framework for the establishment of the ASF and MSC[140] and where applicable the rules of procedure of the Peace and Security Council.[141] 4.5.4. Supporting Institutions In implementing its mandate, the Peace and Security Council works with the various AU organs including the Assembly, Pan-African Parliament and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[142] The following organs were initially designated as supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council: the AU Commission, the Peace Fund, the Continental Early Warning System, the Panel of the Wise, the African Standby Force, and the Military Staff Committee.[143] Additional supporting institutions include the Friends of the Panel of the Wise, the Pan-African Network of the Wise (PanWise), the Committee of Experts, and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. A brief overview of each supporting institution follows. The AU Commission: The Peace and Security directorate is the main organ of the AU Commission responsible for providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council.[144] The Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission provides the Council with a permanent Secretariat to run its day to day activities.[145] Moreover, the Peace and Security directorate of the AU Commission establishes and operationalise all the supporting institutions of the Peace and Security Council namely the Continental Early Warning System, the African Standby Force and the Peace Fund and the Panel of the Wise.[146] Moreover, the Chairperson of the AU Commission has the responsibility to monitor the implementation of decisions adopted by the Peace and Security Council upon the approval of the Assembly.[147] In a bid to strengthen it, the Assembly plans to transform the African Union Commission into the African Union Authority.[148] The Peace Fund: The Peace and Security Council Protocol provides for the establishment of a Special Fund, known as the Peace Fund, in order to finance the activities of the AU aimed at maintaining peace and security in the continent.[149] In July 2016, the Assembly adopted the High Representative for the Fund recommendations to inter alia, have three thematic windows, Mediation and Preventive Diplomacy, Institutional Capacity and Peace Operations as well as clear governance structures and independent fund management. [150] The primary source of the Peace Fund is the regular budget to the African Union, known as the General Peace Fund.[151] The other major category of the Peace Fund is what is called the Special Contribution.[152] Under the Special Contribution, the sources of the Peace fund are voluntary contributions from AU member States, voluntary contributions from the private sector and civil society as well as individuals in AU member States and donations from non-member States.[153] Donations and voluntary contributions from sources outside of Africa are accepted in so far as they are ‘in conformity with the objectives and principles of the Union’. [154] The PSC Protocol also provides for a revolving trust fund within the broader Peace Fund, to provide a standing reserve for specific projects in case of emergencies and unforeseen priorities.[155] The level of funding required in the Trust Fund is to be determined by the relevant AU policy organs on recommendation by the PSC. The Continental Early Warning System: The Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) is a supporting institution designed to carry out the prevention and early warning mandate of the Peace and Security Council.[156] The CEWS is managed by the Conflict Prevention and Early Warning Unit of the Department of Peace and Security. It consists of two important bodies: the main observation and monitoring centre under the Peace and Security directorate located at the headquarters of the AU (called ‘The Situation Room’); and a communication panel with the observation and monitoring rooms in each of the sub-regional organizations.[157] The Situation Room collects and analyses information from ‘the public domain in hard and soft prints, including newspapers both private and public, satellite TV channels, electronic news sites, and from informal sources on the ground.’[158] The information is then processed and compiled in the form of ‘News Briefs’, and is forwarded to the relevant organs of the AU three times a day and should be posted and circulated through the intranet for all staff of the organization.[159] The Situation Room is linked directly with the observation and monitoring units of the Regional Mechanisms that collect and process data at their level and transmit the same to the Situation Room.[160] The Situation Room also benefits from its collaboration with the United Nations agencies and other international organizations, academic institutions and NGOs.[161] The observation and monitoring is based on an early warning module which contains political, economic, social, military and humanitarian indicators.[162] The CEWS holds periodic and on-demand meetings with the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) on matters of mutual concern. The Panel of the Wise: The Panel of the Wise is an advisory body composed of five highly respected African personalities who have made outstanding contribution to the cause of peace and security on the continent.[163] The Panel was created in 2002, and became operational in 2008. Members of the Panel are appointed by the Assembly for a term of three years. The Panel of the Wise advises the Peace and Security Council and the AU Commission on conflict prevention and promotion of stability in Africa.[164] A body similar to the Panel of the Wise, the OAU’s Commission of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration was established on 21 July 1964, as a tool to support peaceful settlement of disputes between OAU Member States.[165] It was however, non-operational and was replaced in 1993 by the broader Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. No panel was set up under the Mechanism. The Friends of the Panel of the Wise: The Friends of the Panel of the Wise, a team of eminent African personalities from the AU’s five regions, was established in 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of the Panel of the Wise.[166] The Friends of the Panel of the Wise are appointed by the Chairperson of the AU Commission and endorsed by the Assembly. Comprised of outgoing members of the Panel of the Wise, the members are expected to attend all Panel meetings and share the same privileges and entitlements as Panel members. The Pan-African Network of the Wise (PanWise): PanWise was conceived at the June 2012 Ouagadougou Retreat of the Panel of the Wise with regional counterparts.[167] In May 2013, the AU Assembly endorsed the establishment of PanWise in order to bring the Panel of the Wise together with similar regional mechanisms, in a bid to strengthen, coordinate and harmonize the prevention of conflicts and peace keeping efforts under a single umbrella. The core members of PanWise are the AU Panel of the Wise/Friends and their existing and future sub-regional counterparts. They include the Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS’s) Council of the Wise, the Southern African Development Community’s (SADC’s) Mediation Reference Group and Panel of Elders, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa’s (COMESA’s) Committee of Elders; and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development’s (IGAD’s) Mediation Contact Group, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), East African Community (EAC), Arab Maghreb Union (UMA), and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States (CEN–SAD). The associate members of PanWise include the Forum of Former African Heads of State, the Association of African Ombudsmen and Mediators (AAOM), National infrastructures for peace, National mediation councils, and All Africa Council of Churches. The African Standby Force: A key enforcement and supporting institution under the Peace and Security Council is the African Standby Force. The Peace and Security Protocol provides for the establishment of the African Standby Force, composed of a standby arrangement of multi-national and multi-disciplinary civilian, police and military personnel, for the purpose of implementing the peacekeeping and intervention mandate of the AU.[168] Five regional groupings: Central African Standby Force (CASF), Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF), North African Regional Capability (NARC), Southern Africa Standby Force (SASF), and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Standby Force, were envisaged to be fully operational by December 2015.[169] The AU Assembly declared the African Standby Force (ASF) operationally ready in January 2016,[170] but it has not been deployed in its originally designed form. The Peace Support Operations Division, formerly known as the Continental Planning Element of the African Standby Force, was set up to plan, launch, sustain and liquidate peace support operations as authorized by the African Union (AU).[171] The Division also assists in directing and managing such operations. The AU has been involved in several Peace Support Operations (PSOs), either alone or jointly with the United Nations since 2003.[172] African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC): The African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) was established in principle, on an interim basis by the AU Assembly at its May 2013 Summit. ACIRC was established to address the Africa’s rapid response deficit and until ASF and its rapid deployment capability becomes fully operational.[173] The purpose of the ACIRC is to provide the AU with a flexible and robust force, made up of military, police and civilian personnel, and equipment and resources voluntarily provided by willing and capable Member States, to be deployed very rapidly to effectively respond to emergency situations, within the framework of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA).[174] In January 2014, the AU Assembly at its 22nd ordinary session decided to operationalize ACIRC as a transitional arrangement.[175] Twelve Member States volunteered to be the initial participating countries.[176] The volunteering nations have so far conducted three command-post military exercises: November 2014 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, August 2016 in Paradise Valley, Bengo province, Angola and March 2017 at Rwanda Military Academy-Gako, as part of the preparation for readiness of the pledged capabilities. The following proposed committees of the PSC are not yet fully operational: Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD); Sanctions, Counter-Terrorism, Resource Mobilisation; and Procedures and Mechanisms for Peace Support Operations. 4.6. The Pan-African Parliament The AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament (PAP) whose functions, composition and powers are provided for under a separate protocol, the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community Relating to the Pan-African Parliament.[177] The 2001 Protocol is to be replaced upon entry into force of the Protocol to the Constitutive Act of the African Union Relating to the Pan-African Parliament.[178] Adopted by the AU Assembly in 2014, the new Protocol comes into force 30 days after the deposit of instruments of ratification by a simple majority of AU Member States. As at September 2016, 13 Member States have signed the Protocol and 5 have ratified it. The Protocol for the establishment of the PAP provides that Parliamentarians be elected from the Parliament or equivalent legislative organs of each member state.[179] Each Member State of the AU has five Parliamentarians in the PAP selected from both ruling and opposition parties participating in the national parliaments of member States and at least one of whom must be a woman.[180] The tenure of the Parliamentarians in the PAP runs concurrently with their tenure at their national parliament.[181] However, the parliamentarians act and vote independently of their national parliament once they are sworn in the PAP.[182] In its daily activities the PAP is run by a Bureau composed of a president and four vice-presidents elected from all sub-regions based on equitable geographical representation and supported by a Clerk and deputy Clerks .[183] The idea behind the establishment of the PAP is the representation of the African people and their grass-root organizations in the deliberations and decisions of the policy organs of the AU.[184] The PAP is given the mandate to ‘exercise advisory and consultative powers only’ to the Assembly and to all policy organs of the Union either at the request of the AU organs or at its own initiative.[185] In order to carry out its mandate, the PAP is given, inter alia, the power to discuss and make recommendations and pass resolutions on issues of importance and relevance to the continent such as the promotion of peace and security and protection of human rights and democracy.[186] The PAP is also given the mandate to issue invitations to the representatives of policy organs of the Union and member States “to furnish explanations in plenary on issues affecting or likely to affect the life of the African Union.”[187] The members of the PAP are entitled to forward their questions to any policy organ of the AU through the President of the PAP while the President of the PAP can in consultation with the Bureau, invite the Chairperson of the Assembly to explain a decision taken by the Assembly to the PAP.[188] The AU Commission is obliged to submit annual report on the activities of the Union to the PAP.[189] The permanent committees meet at least twice a year in ordinary sessions,[190] while a request for extraordinary session by two-thirds of the PAP members, the Assembly or the Executive Council of the Union can be made at any time.[191] All sessions of the PAP are open for the public unless there is the PAP Bureau decides otherwise.[192] The President of the PAP attends AU Assembly sessions and presents the reports of the PAP to the Assembly.[193] The PAP is operational and sits in South Africa.[194] The PAP budget, including the allowances for its members, is part of the overall AU budget.[195] 4.7. The Court of Justice The Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the Court of Justice of the Union whose statute, composition, and functions are defined in a separate protocol.[196] Identified as the ‘principal judicial organ of the Union’, its statute, composition, and functions were defined in a separate protocol. [197] Although, the Protocol of the Court entered into force in February 2009, 30 days after 15 Member States had ratified it, the Court never became operational. As at 15 June 2017, 44 Member States have signed the 2003 Protocol and 18 have ratified it; the latest ratification on 19 December 2016. In 2008, the AU Assembly merged the Court with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights into a single court, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights. 4.8. The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights (the Court) was not established by the AU Constitutive Act.[198] The initiative for the establishment of the Court started officially with a resolution adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, in June 1994. The Secretary-General was requested to convene a Government legal experts` meeting to deliberate, in conjunction with the African Commission, on how to enhance the efficiency of the African Commission and to consider in particular the establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples Rights.[199] A draft document on an African human rights court was produced by a meeting of experts organized by the OAU Secretariat in collaboration with the African C omission and the International Commission of Jurists, in September 1995.[200] The draft document formed the basis of the first official draft protocol, the Cape Town Draft which was produced a few days later by an OAU meeting of government legal experts.[201] After further elaboration and refining, the Draft Protocol was adopted by the conference of OAU Ministers of Justice/Attorneys General in December 1997.[202] The OAU Council of Ministers adopted the Draft Protocol in February1998, and in June 1998, the 34th ordinary session of the General Assembly adopted and opened the Protocol for signature. The Court was established by the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, (the Protocol).[203] The Court was established to ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights in Africa.[204] The Court complements and reinforces the functions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights.[205] The Court has jurisdiction over all cases and disputes submitted to it concerning the interpretation and application of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, this Protocol and any other relevant human rights instrument ratified by the States concerned.[206] The Court receives complaints and/or applications submitted to it either by the African Commission of Human and Peoples’ Rights or State parties to the Protocol or African Intergovernmental Organizations.[207] Non-Governmental Organizations with observer status before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and individuals can also institute cases directly before the Court, if the State Party involved has made a Declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the Court.[208] As at March 2014, only seven countries have made such a Declaration. The Court is composed of eleven judges who are nationals of Member States of the African Union.[209] The Judges of the Court are elected, after nomination by their respective States, in their individual capacities from among African jurists of proven integrity and of recognized practical, judicial or academic competence and experience in the field of human rights.[210] The judges are elected for a six year or four year term, renewable once.[211] The President and Vice-President of the Court are elected by the judges from among themselves, and serve a two year term. They can be re-elected only once.[212] All the judges, except the President of the Court, work on a part-time basis.[213] The Court officially started its operations in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in November 2006, but in August 2007 it moved to its seat in Arusha, the United Republic of Tanzania. Initially, ‘the Court dealt principally with operational and administrative issues, including the development of the structure of the Court&#39;s Registry, preparation of its budget and drafting of its Interim Rules of Procedure’.[214] The judges adopted the Interim Rules of the Court in 2008. The final Rules of Court was adopted in June 2010, after consultation with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, in order to harmonize the rules of both institutions.[215] The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights remains provisionally in force until the entry into force of the 2008 Protocol and the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights; that is, after 15 Member States have ratified the 2008 Protocol. As at 15 June 2017, 30 states have signed the 2008 Protocol and only 6 have ratified it. 4.9. The African Court of Justice and Human Rights In July 2004, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government decided that the Court of Justice ‘should be integrated into one Court’ with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights citing financial and logistical constraints to establish two different courts.[216] In July 2008, the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government adopted the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, merging the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the Court of Justice of the African Union into a single Court, named the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.[217] The Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (Single Protocol) adopted July 2008) is to replace the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights (the old Protocol), and the Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union.[218] The African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights is still in operation in spite of its merger with the Court of Justice,[219] because the Protocol and the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights is not yet in force. As at 8 February 2018 only six (6) of the mandatory fifteen (15) Member States have deposited their instruments of ratification. However, according to Justice Sylvain Sore, president of the African Court on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights, its mandate will not be usurped by the proposed Single court. The Court will remain separate, obligated to its mandate but as a chamber of the new Court.[220] 4.10. Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) In August 2012, the African Union and Senegal established the Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) within the Senegalese judicial system to “prosecute and try the person(s) most responsible for crimes and serious violations of international law, customary international law and international conventions ratified by Chad, committed on the territory of Chad during the period from 7 June 1982 to 1 December 1990.”[221] The Chambers’ jurisdiction covers genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture,[222] setting a precedent as an internationalized criminal tribunal operating exclusively on the basis of universal jurisdiction. The Court comprises the Investigative/Pre-Trial Chamber, Indictment Chamber, Trial Chamber and Appeals Chamber.[223] Article 11 of the EAC Statute provides that the Chambers shall be composed of two Senegalese judges and two alternate Senegalese judges, and an AU Member State non-Senegalese president, nominated by the Senegalese Minister of Justice and appointed by the Chairperson of the AU Commission. The Extraordinary African Chambers shall be dissolved in their own right once all judgments are final.[224] Inaugurated in February 2013 in Dakar, Senegal, the Chambers convicted Hissène Habré, former President of Chad (1982–90) of crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture, and sentenced him to life imprisonment on 30 May 2016. On April 27, 2017, an appeals court confirmed the verdict. 4.11. The Commission The AU Commission is a permanent organ established by the AU Constitutive Act.[225] The Commission is the administrative wing of the AU accountable to the Assembly and the Executive Council.[226] The AU Commission is given numerous administrative functions and mandate that include administrating the AU institutions; coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU such as Assembly , the Executive Council , the Peace and Security Council of the Union in collaboration with the organs; providing operational support to the Peace and Security Council; initiating proposals on the budget and wide range of regional issues; organizing and managing meetings and accepting donations and grants that are compatible with the objectives and principles of the Union; and depositing the treaties adopted and ratified under the aegis of the African Union.[227] The AU Commission is composed of the Chairperson, the deputy Chairperson and eight Commissioners all of whom are appointed by the Assembly based on gender balance and equitable representation of all sub-regions.[228] Once appointed, all officials of the AU Commission are only responsible to the AU and not to any government and external authority.[229] The officials are assisted by all necessary staff in running the Commission located at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[230] The Chairperson of the Commission is the Chief Executive Officer and legal representative of the AU and is mandated to carry out many essential functions such as the overall responsibility of the finances and administration of the Commission, the preparation of its budget, participating in the meetings of the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Peace and Security Council and keep records of the deliberations, follow up and report on the implementation of the decisions of the policy organs of the AU, appoint staff of the Commission and carry out any function that is assigned to him by the Assembly and the Executive Council.[231] The Chairperson is accountable to the Executive Council.[232] The Deputy Chairperson is accountable to the Chairperson and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Organization.[233] The eight Commissioners are accountable to the Chairperson of the Commission and each Commissioner heads one of the eight departments/directorates of the Commission established along the eight portfolios of the Commission.[234] The portfolios of the Commission are Political Affairs; Peace and Security; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; and Economic Affairs.[235] The Third ordinary session of the Executive Council of the AU maintained the portfolios as departments of the Commission.[236] The Department of Social Affairs oversees two specialized offices: the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN) and the Centre for Linguistic and Historical Studies by Oral Tradition (CELHTO). The Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture oversees the five specialized technical offices: Coordinating Office for the Development Project of the Fouta Djallon Region;[237] African Union-Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR); African Union-Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC); African Union-Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (AU-PATTEC); and the Semi-Arid Food Grain Research and Development (SAFGRAD). It also works with the African Union-Inter-African Phyto-sanitary Council (AU-IAPSC). The Commissioner for Human Resources, Science and Technology oversees the Scientific, Technical and Research Commission (STRC).[238] The Department of Peace and Security is the liaison point for the work of the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism.[239] The Commission consists of directorates and organizational units under the offices of the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission. The Bureau of the Chairperson, the Directorate for Women, Gender and Development; the Directorate for Strategic Policy Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, International Cooperation and Resource Mobilization; the Communication and Information Unit; and Protocol Services Unit; the NEPAD Coordination Unit; the Secretariat of the CSSDCA; the Office of the Legal Counsel; the Office of the Internal Auditor; the Office of the Secretary-General to the Commission; Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO); and the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) are under the office of the Chairperson.[240] The Directorate for Administration and Human Resources Development; the Directorate for Programming, Budgeting, Finance and Accounting; the Medical Services Directorate; and the Directorate for Conference Services are under the Office of the Deputy Chairperson.[241] The self-funding Technical Committee of Experts for the Implementation of the Diaspora Legacy Projects was established in 2013 by the Assembly. The Committee is composed of the heads or representatives of the following institutions and sectors: AU Commission; New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA); African Development Bank (AfDB); United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); Regional Economic Communities (RECs); Africa Capacity Building Institute; the private sector; African Diaspora; and implementing agencies.[242] The Technical Committee of Experts is to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the Five Legacy Projects that were adopted at the Global African Diaspora Summit in May 2012, and endorsed by the Assembly in July 2012.[243] 4.12. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council The AU Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) is an advisory body composed of representatives of civil society, professional groups and cultural groups both in Africa and in the Diaspora.[244] The main idea behind the establishment of the ECOSOCC is the broad participation of the ordinary African citizens through representative civil society organizations and professional groups in the activities of the Union.[245] Thus, the main objectives of the ECOSOCC include the participation of the African Civil Society in the promulgation and implementation of the policies and norms of the AU and the development of communication between the ordinary citizens of Africa on common issues of the continent.[246] Based on its objectives, the ECOSOCC is given the task of popularization of the AU norms among the citizens of Africa and giving advisory services to the organs of the Union how best to implement the norms and policies of the Organization at its own initiative or at the request of organs of the Union.[247] The structures of the ECOSOCC include its General Assembly; an 18 member Standing Committee; 10 Sectoral Cluster Committees; and Credentials Committee.[248] The General Assembly is the highest decision making organ[249] with 150 civil society organizations (CSOs) at the level of member states, sub-regions, the continent, the African diaspora and ex-officio members appointed by the Commission.[250] The election of member states, regional, continental and Diaspora representatives is based on 50 percent gender equality and 50 percent aged between 18 and 35. Members are elected for four-year terms and may be re-elected once.[251] The Standing Committee appointed by the General Assembly coordinates the work of ECOSOCC, while the Sectoral Cluster Committees advise on the following areas: Peace and Security; Political Affairs; Infrastructure and Energy; Social Affairs and Health; Human Resources, Science and Technology; Trade and Industry; Rural Economy and Agriculture; Economic Affairs; Women and Gender; and Cross-Cutting Programmes (such as HIV/AIDS, international cooperation and coordination with other AU institutions and organs).[252] The Credentials Committee is responsible for examining the credentials of ECOSOCC members and their representatives.[253] The Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) office in the AU Commission acts as the Secretariat for ECOSOCC, pending arrangements for the relocation of the Secretariat to Zambia.[254] The AU ECOSOCC was launched on March 27-30, 2005 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at the headquarters of the AU.[255] During the launching conference, the Interim General Assembly of the ECOSOCC swore in the late Wangari Maathai, Nobel Laureate from Kenya, as the President of the Bureau of the Interim General Assembly of ECOSOCC with four deputies from the centre, north, south and west sub-regions.[256] The mandate of the first ECOSOCC General Assembly session launched on, 9 September 2008, expired in September 2012. The second permanent General Assembly of ECOSOCC was inaugurated on 22 December 2014 in Nairobi, Kenya.[257] Its mandate ends in December 2018.[258] In January 2016, the Assembly adopted ECOSOCC’s Rules of Procedure.[259] 4.13. The Financial Institutions The Constitutive Act of the AU envisaged the establishment of the African Central Bank, the African Monetary Fund and the African Investment Bank as the three new financial institutions under the Union.[260] The rules and regulations for the establishment of the African Central Bank are yet to be provided in a separate protocol. The fourth ordinary session of the AU Assembly requested the Chairperson of the Commission to prepare the legal instruments for the establishment of the three financial institutions.[261] The Assembly session also decided that the African Central Bank should be located in the Western sub-region while the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund should be located in the Northern and Central sub-regions respectively.[262] Accordingly Nigeria was selected as the host country for the future African Central Bank while Libya and Cameroon were chosen to host the African Investment Bank and African Monetary Fund respectively.[263] A flagship programme of the AUC Agenda 2063, the African Central Bank is a joint project in collaboration with the Bureau of the African Central Bank Association (AACB). The implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Strategy on the establishment of the African Central Bank is expected to start in 2018.[264] 4.13.1. The African Monetary Fund On 27 June 2014, the AU Assembly at its 23rd ordinary session adopted the Protocol and the Statute for the establishment of the African Monetary Fund (AMF); with an initial capital of 22.64 billion dollars.[265] The Protocol and the Statute shall enter into force on ratification by 15 of the 54 of the Member States of the African Union and the payment of at least 25 per cent of the minimum paid-up capital.[266] As at 8 February 2018, 10 Member States have signed the Protocol but none has ratified it. The purpose of the Fund is to foster macroeconomic stability, sustainable shared economic growth and balanced development in the continent, in order to facilitate the effective and predictable integration of African economies.[267] The objectives of the African Monetary Fund are to provide financial assistance to AU Member States; act as a clearing house as well as undertake macro-economic purveyance within the continent; co-ordinate the monetary policies of Member States and promote cooperation between the monetary authorities in these states; and encourage capital movements between member states.[268] The functions and activities of the Fund include promoting and facilitating trade, the settlement of commercial payment and encouraging capital flow between State Parties; providing short-term and medium-term credit facilities to sustain balance of payment and providing technical assistance and policy advice, to States Parties; with a view to assisting in financing their overall balance of payments deficits.[269] The agreed timeframe under Agenda 2063 for establishing the AMF is 2023.[270] The Headquarters of the African Monetary Fund is to be in Yaoundé, Republic of Cameroon.[271] 4.13.2. The African Investment Bank On 4th February 2009, the AU Assembly at its 12th ordinary session adopted the Protocol on the African Investment Bank and the Statute annexed to it.[272] The Annexes to the Statutes of the African Investment Bank were adopted on 2nd February 2010 at the 14th ordinary session of the Assembly.[273] The Protocol shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the Protocol.[274] As at 15 June 2017, 22 member states have signed the Protocol and 5 have ratified it. The Statute of the African Investment Bank shall enter into force thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification.[275] The agreed timeframe under Agenda 2063 for establishing the AIB was 2016, but as at 15 June 2017, 22 Member States have signed the Protocol and only 5 have ratified it. The purpose of the Bank is to foster economic integration and development in line with the objectives of the Union.[276] The objectives of the Bank are to promote investment activities of the public and private sector intended to advance regional integration of the Member States of the African Union; utilize available resources for the implementation of investment projects contributing to strengthening the private sector and modernization of rural sector activities and infrastructures; mobilize resources from capital markets inside and outside Africa for the financing of investment projects in African countries; and provide technical assistance as may be needed in African countries for the study, preparation, financing and execution of investment projects.[277] The Headquarters of the Bank will be in Tripoli, Libya.[278] 4.14. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights forms part of the African regional system of human rights, which has its basis on the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[279] The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights established the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as an organ of implementation of its substantive provisions.[280] The AU Constitutive Act does not recognize the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one of the organs of the AU. However, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights was incorporated as an organ of the AU in 2002.[281] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is composed of eleven members elected by the AU Executive Committee from member States and appointed by the AU Assembly.[282] The members of the Commission serve in their personal capacity.[283] The Commission is run by a Secretariat in its daily activities.[284] The budget of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is provided by the AU as part of the overall budget of the AU Commission.[285] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given three mandates: promotional, protective and interpretative.[286] Under the promotional mandate, the Commission works for the awareness of human rights in Africa through different methods such as publication, research on human rights problems in Africa and collaboration with African and other international institutions concerned with the protection of human and peoples’ rights.[287] The protective mandate of the Commission generally provides that the Commission shall ‘ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter.’[288] Under the protective mandate, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights examine State reports, inter-state communications, and in limited cases, individual complaints of human rights violations. [289] The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is given the general power to ‘resort to any appropriate method of investigation’ thereby giving it some latitude to adopt investigation methods within the bounds of its protective mandate.[290] Consequently, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has developed other important protective functions over the years. The use of fact-finding missions in member States and the appointment of Special Rapporteur on thematic issues of human rights on the continent are the two main protective functions undertaken by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.[291] All the above-mentioned protective measures of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights result in reports and recommendations which are communicated to the concerned State parties and to the Assembly of the AU.[292] The AU Assembly may request the Commission to make further in-depth investigation if it believes that the report of the Commission indicates serious human rights violations.[293] Any measure that may be taken by the Commission within its protective mandate remains confidential until the AU Assembly decides otherwise.[294] 5. Other Bodies Related to the African Union 5.1. Committee of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa (CISSA) CISSA was established on 26 August 2004 in Abuja, Nigeria, by the Heads of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa. It was endorsed at the 4th ordinary session of AU Assembly in Abuja, in January 2005.[295] CISSA is envisaged to provide leadership on intelligence and security matters in furtherance of peace, security and stability in Africa. It does so by facilitating dialogue, study, analysis, consultation, coordination and adoption of common strategies towards common security challenges among Intelligence and Security Organizations in Africa. CISSA has three permanent bodies: the Conference, composed of Heads of Intelligence and Security Services of Member States; the Panel of Experts (PoE), comprising the representatives from each member of CISSA; and the Secretariat, which is based in Addis Ababa for easy coordination with the African Union. The Secretariat is staffed on the principle of equitable regional representation by officers, recruited from Intelligence and Security Services that are Members of CISSA. 5.2. African Union Advisory Board on Corruption The Advisory Board on Corruption was established as part of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption which was adopted in July 2003 and entered into force in August 2006. The Board’s mandate is to promote and encourage States Parties to adopt measures and actions to meet the Convention’s objectives, and to follow up the application of those measures.[296] The Convention objectives include, inter alia, to promote and strengthen the development in Africa by each State Party of mechanisms required to prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption and related offences in the public and private sectors; promote, facilitate and regulate cooperation among the State Parties to ensure the effectiveness of such measures and actions; coordinate and harmonize relevant policies and legislation between State Parties.[297] The Advisory Board is composed of eleven (11) members who serve in their personal capacities for two years, renewable once.[298] The Board members are elected by the Executive Council from among a list of experts nominated by Member States, and who are of the highest integrity, impartiality, and recognized competence in matters relating to preventing and combating corruption and related offences. In the election of the members of the Board, the Executive Council is to ensure adequate gender representation, and equitable geographical representation.[299] The Advisory Board on Corruption is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[300] 5.3.

AUCIL has 5 specific objectives: to undertake activities relating to codification and progressive development of international law; to propose draft framework agreements, model regulations, formulations and analyses of emerging trends in States’ practice to facilitate the codification and progressive development of international law; to assist in the revision of existing treaties, assist in the identification of areas in which new treaties are required and prepare drafts thereof; to conduct studies on legal matters of interest to the Union and its Member States; and to encourage the teaching, study, publication and dissemination of literature on international law; in particular the laws of the Union.[302] The members of AUCIL are elected by the AU Executive Council based on the principles of equitable geographical representation, the principal legal systems and gender representation. The eleven (11) members serve in their personal capacities, and must have recognised competence in international law. No two members shall be nationals of the same State.[303] Members are elected by secret ballot,[304] for five-year terms, renewable once.[305] Members perform their duties on a part-time basis.[306] AUCIL is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.[307] 5.4. Treaty Bodies, Specialized Agencies and Other Bodies 5.4.1. African Union-Inter-African Phyto-Sanitary Council (AU-IAPSC) The Phyto-Sanitary Convention for Africa was adopted in September 1967 and entered into force in October 1992. AU-IAPSC is a technical office of the AU Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture. It is one of the 10 Regional Plant Protection Organizations of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). AU-IAPSC works with the national plant protection organizations of Member States of the AU on phyto-sanitary issues in Africa; including the vulnerability of African crop production systems to the impact of diseases, insect pests, and noxious weeds; economic losses incurred through spoilage; noncompliance with ISPMs, trade regulations, and equivalents; and dearth of phyto-sanitary data.[308] AU-IAPSC generally implements its activities through the eight (8) African Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and sub-RECs.[309] AU-IAPSC is governed by a General Assembly, Steering Committee and Secretariat, under the umbrella of the AU. AU-IAPSC is based in Yaoundé, Cameroon.[310] 5.4.2. African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) The African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) was created by the Constitutional Conference jointly convened by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa in 1964. AFCAC began functioning in 1969 and its Constitution was adopted by the OAU in January 1969 and entered into force in March 1972. It became an OAU specialized agency on 11 May 1978. The AU adopted the revised Constitution in 2003 and 2009.[311] The revised 2009 Constitution provisionally entered into force in May 2010.[312] The objectives of AFCAO include coordinating civil aviation matters in Africa and cooperating with ICAO and all other relevant organizations and other bodies which are involved in the promotion and development of civil aviation in Africa; facilitating, coordinating and ensuring the successful implementation of the Yamoussoukro Decision by supervising and managing Africa&#39;s liberalized air transport industry; and formulating and enforcing appropriate rules and regulations that give fair and equal opportunity to all stakeholders and promote fair competition.[313] AFCAC governance structure is made up of 3 organs: the Bureau, the Secretariat and the Plenary. The triennial Plenary of all Member States is the supreme organ of AFCAC.[314] The Bureau is composed of a president, five vice-presidents (one for each geographical region of Africa), and the Coordinator of the African Group of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council.[315] The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General.[316] AFCAC is based in Dakar-Yoff, Senegal.[317] On 28 January 2018, 23 African countries launched the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM), an initiative of the African Union. Largely based on the agreements of the 1999 Yamoussoukro Decision, the initiative will enhance connectivity between African nations and lead to a reduction in flight ticket prices.[318] 5.4.3. African Rehabilitation Institute (ARI) In 1988, the African Rehabilitation Institute (ARI) was established in Harare, Zimbabwe. ARI was set up to promote and develop training and research programmes in the field of rehabilitation and disability prevention in Africa.[319] The Institute consists of a Central Planning and Co-coordinating Unit and existing institutions and facilities throughout the African region form the decentralized branches of the ARI.[320] The organs of the Institute are the Conference of African Ministers responsible for Social Affairs; the Governing Board; the Technical Advisory Committee; and the General Secretariat of the Institute; and the Regional Centres.[321] ARI collaborates with African governments, African and international non-governmental organizations, and UN specialized agencies to develop African self-reliance in disability-related fields. Membership is open to all AU Member States, international organizations and non-governmental organizations.[322] 5.4.4. Secretariat to the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Importation into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes Within Africa The Bamako Convention bans the importation of hazardous wastes.[323] The objective of the Convention is to strictly regulate the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes to and within Africa. The Convention provides for a Secretariat to serve a Conference of the Parties along with financial arrangements.[324] The Conference of Parties which took place in Bamako, Mali, in June 2013 agreed that UN Environment Programme (UNEP) should host the Secretariat for the Bamako Convention, and that designated Centres for the Basel and Stockholm conventions in Africa are ipso facto designated centres for the Bamako Convention.[325] 5.4.5. Secretariat to the African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (Maputo Convention) The Maputo Convention is a revised version of the Algiers Convention of 1968 on the same topic.[326] The Maputo Convention has stronger institutional mechanisms for effective implementation than the Algiers Convention.[327] The Revised Convention entered into force on 11 July 2016.[328] The objectives of the Convention are to enhance environmental protection; foster the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources; and harmonize and coordinate policies in these fields with a view to achieving ecologically rational, economically sound and socially acceptable development policies and programmes.[329] The AU Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture currently acts as the Convention Secretariat. 5.4.6. African Energy Commission (AFREC) AFREC was established by the Convention of the African Energy Commission, which was adopted in July 2001 and entered into force in December 2006. AFREC is an AU Commission technical agency responsible for supporting the energy sector’s functions of developing and managing energy resources across Africa. AFREC’s objectives include to map out energy development policies, strategies and plans based on sub-regional, regional and continental development priorities and recommend their implementation; design, create and update an energy continental data base and facilitate rapid dissemination of information and exchange of information among Member States, as well as among the Regional Economic Communities (RECs); and to encourage research and development in the energy sector.[330] AFREC reports to the Conference of African Energy Ministers CAMEN. The African Electrotechnical Standardization Commission (AFSEC), a subsidiary of AFREC was launched in February 2008. AFREC is based in Algiers, Algeria.[331] 5.4.7. African Commission on Nuclear Energy (AFCONE) The African Commission on Nuclear Energy (AFCONE) was established by the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty (Pelindaba Treaty) which was adopted in November 2001 and entered into force in July 2009. The Parties are obliged not to conduct research on, develop, manufacture, stockpile or otherwise acquire, possess, or have control over any nuclear explosive device by any means anywhere; not to seek or receive any assistance in the research on, development, manufacture, stockpiling or acquisition, or possession of any nuclear explosive device; and not to take any action to assist or encourage the research on, development, manufacture, stockpiling or acquisition, or possession of any nuclear explosive device.[332] The Parties also undertake to prohibit, in their territory, the stationing of any nuclear explosive device.[333] The Commission promotes peaceful nuclear cooperation, at the bilateral, sub-regional and regional levels.[334] The first Conference of States Parties agreed that its headquarters will be in South Africa. Currently, AFCONE is based at the AU Commission’s Department of Infrastructure and Energy in Addis Ababa, pending the establishment of a permanent secretariat in South Africa. 5.4.8. African Union Institute for Statistics The African Charter on Statistics was adopted on 4 February 2009 and entered into force in February 2015. The objectives of the Charter, inter alia, are to serve as the policy framework for, and as an advocacy tool and instrument for statistics development in Africa; and to ensure improved quality and comparability of the statistics required to monitor the economic and social integration process in the continent.[335] In 2015, the AU Assembly approved the establishment of two (2) institutions: the AU Institute of Statistics to be based in Tunis, Tunisia and the African Statistical Training Centre that will be based in Yamoussoukro, Cote d’Ivoire.[336] Both institutions shall be established under article 7 of the African Charter on Statistics which provides for an appropriate mechanism for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Charter. The institutions were expected to start operation in 2016.[337] On 2 February 2018, the Department of Economic Affairs and Tunisian Government officials signed the Host Agreement for the African Union Institute for Statistics in Africa (STATAFRIC) to be based in Tunis.[338] 5.4.9. Pan African Youth Union The Pan African Youth Movement (PYM), the predecessor of the Pan African Youth Union (PYU), was established on April 26, 1962.

African Union Observatory for Science, Technology and Innovation (AOSTI) In February 2009, the AU Assembly at its 12th Summit in Addis Ababa endorsed Equatorial Guinea’s offer to host the Observatory for Science, Technology and Innovation (AOSTI).[357] At the joint meeting of the African Union (AU)-UNESCO Commission held on 9-12 March 2009, the AU requested assistance from UNESCO in establishing AOSTI. The AU Assembly adopted the Statute of the African Observatory in Science Technology and Innovation at its 26th ordinary session in January 2016.[358] The aim of AOSTI is to stimulate and promote the use of science and technology in supporting sustainable development in Africa. The AOSTI is a continental repository for science, technology and innovation (STI) statistics and a source of policy analysis in support of evidence based policy making in order to assist Africa countries manage and use statistical information in accordance with the African Charter of Statistics.[359] The objectives of AOSTI include: enabling African countries to use their STI capabilities to solve pressing economic, social, environmental and other development challenges; strengthening national capacities for STI policy formulation, implementation, evaluation and review; provide African decision-makers with current STI information; strengthening national and RECs capacities for technology prospecting, acquisition or procurement; and reinforcing regional and international STI cooperation.[360] The AOSTI is governed by the AU Specialized Technical Committee on Education, Science and Technology (STC), the Steering Committee and the Secretariat.[361] AOSTI is based in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.[362] 5.4.14. Pan African University (PAU) The Pan African University is an initiative of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union. It is a premier continental university network whose mission is to provide wholesome postgraduate education geared towards the achievement of a prosperous, integrated and peaceful Africa.[363] The AU Assembly adopted the Statutes of the Pan African University at its 20th ordinary session in January 2013.[364] The Pan African University is an academic network of existing African institutions operating at graduate level.[365] PAU is supported by the Association of African Universities. PAU is expected to create high quality continental institutions to bridge the educational gap between Africa and other parts of the world and to promote innovative teaching, learning and research within Africa. PAU’s objectives include: developing continent-wide and world-class graduate and postgraduate programmes in science, technology, innovation, humanities and social sciences and governance; stimulating collaborative, internationally competitive, leading edge fundamental and economic growth-oriented research; and enhancing the mobility of students and academic staff among African universities to improve teaching and collaborative research.[366] Article 14 of the PAU Statute provides for the establishment of an endowment fund based on voluntary contributions from AU Member States, Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and AU partners. PAU is designed to operate in a series of thematic hubs in five geographic sub-regions.[367] The five thematic areas are: Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya; Life and Earth Sciences, including Health and Agriculture at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria; Governance, Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Yaoundé II, and the University of Buea, Cameroon; Water and Energy Sciences, including climate change, at the University of Tlemcen, Algeria.

The Revised Statutes of the Pan African University provides for five PAU management organs: the PAU Council, the Rectorate, Directorates of Institutes, Boards of Institutes, and the PAU Senate.[368] The Rector of the PAU is equivalent in rank to the Vice Chancellor of the host University housing the PAU Institute. Cameroon is the host country of PAU’s Rectorate.[369] 5.4.15. African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency The AU Assembly at its 19th ordinary session in Addis Ababa in July 2012 endorsed in principle the proposal to establish a financial entity, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency.[370] The Agreement for the Establishment of the African Risk Capacity has entered into force.[371] The objective of the ARC Agency is to assist the Member states to reduce the risk of loss and damage caused by extreme weather events and natural disasters therefore protecting the food security of their vulnerable populations.[372] The ARC Agency uses Africa RiskView, an advanced satellite weather surveillance and software, developed by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), to estimate and trigger readily available funds to African countries hit by severe weather events.[373] The organs of the ARC Agency are the Conference of the Parties; the Governing Board; and the Secretariat.[374] The Conference of the Parties is composed of all Parties to the Agreement, represented by Ministers or authorized representatives.[375] The quorum for a Conference of the Parties shall be a simple majority of the Parties of the ARC Agency.[376] The Governing Board is composed of five (5) members, and one (1) alternate for each such member.[377] The Secretariat is currently headed by the first African General Manager.[378] The ARC Agency is based in Johannesburg, South Africa.[379] 5.4.16. Pan African Intellectual Property Organisation (PAIPO) In January 2013, the AU Assembly at its 20th ordinary summit in Addis Ababa agreed to establish the Pan African Intellectual Property Organization (PAIPO).[380] The creation of PAIPO was first proposed at the 5th ordinary session of the African Union Conference of Ministers in charge of Science and Technology (AMCOST V) held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, from 12 to 15 November 2012.[381] The creation of PAIPO is in recognition of the need to address the continued need to promote creativity and utilization of the Intellectual Property system amongst Member States.[382] Tunisia has offered to host PAIPO.[383] PAIPO is scheduled to begin operations in 2018 and be fully functional by 2023.[384] Its Statute was adopted in January 2016[385] and will enter into force 30 days after 15 Member States have ratified it.[386] As at 8 February, 2018, 3 member states have signed the Statute but none has ratified it. PAIPO will be composed of a Conference of States Parties, Council of Ministers, Secretariat and Board of Appeal, [387] and will be based in Tunisia.[388] 6. The Relation Between the AU and Sub-Regional Organizations Currently there are over ten sub-regional organizations in Africa. The African Union initially recognized eight sub-regional organizations: Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Common Market of East and Southern Africa (COMESA), Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD), Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), Economic Community of Sahelo-Saharian States (CEN-SAD) and East African Community (EAC).[389] The AU has recognized two additional sub-regional organizations: the East African Stand-by Force Command (EASFCOM) and the North African Regional Capability (NARC).[390] The African sub-regional organizations were initially established as economic communities in their respective sub-region. There is no clear framework to coordinate the economic objectives of the AU with the sub-regional organizations. Moreover, the major sub-regional organizations have developed norms and institutions on security. In this regard, the Peace and Security Council Protocol provides that the sub-regional organizations are part and parcel of the continental security architecture.[391] The African Common Defense and Security Policy reaffirms that sub-regional organizations are the implementing institutions of the AU norms on the prevention, management and resolution of conflict under the umbrella of the Peace and Security Council.[392] In January 2008, the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation on Peace and Security between the AU and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs)/ Regional Mechanisms (RMs) for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was concluded in Addis Ababa.[393] All REC/RMs have signed the MOU. The last to do so was the North African Regional Capability (NARC), in September 2011. In the framework of this MOU, the parties hold regular meetings, joint missions and consultations, inter alia, working together to make the African Standby Force (ASF) fully operational. 7. The Status of the AU Under the UN Charter The UN Charter provides the following characteristics of regional organizations under Article 52(1): Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided that such arrangement or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations. The words ‘agencies’ or ‘arrangements’ under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter refer to the kind of regional organisation that member States may establish.[394] Thus, ‘arrangements’ are organisations based on multilateral treaties among States while ‘agencies’ refer to regional organisations with various kinds of organs of implementation of the multilateral treaties.[395] The criteria for determining whether an organisation is a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter are two: [396] 1) The organisation should play a role in the maintenance of international peace and security as is appropriate for regional action. 2) The objectives of organisation and its activities should be compatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. When seen against the above criteria, the AU can be characterised as a regional organisation under Article 52(1) of the UN Charter as it is meant to play a role in the maintenance of peace and security in Africa[397] and observe the purposes and principles of the UN.[398] Moreover, the Protocol for the establishment of the AU Peace and Security Council as well as the various statements of the AU organs indicate that the AU considers itself as a regional organization within the meaning of Article 52(1) of the UN Charter.[399] For instance, in its 10th ordinary session, the AU Assembly called upon the UN ‘to examine, within the context of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, the possibility of funding, through assessed contributions, peacekeeping operations undertaken by African Union or under its authority and with the consent of the United Nations.’[400] In its various communications, the UN Security Council has also recognised the AU as a regional organisation within the parameter of the principles laid down in Articles 52 and 53 of the UN Charter. [401] 8. The Status of the AU Treaties The transformation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) into the new continental organization of the AU in 2001 makes it necessary to discuss the current status of the treaties that were signed and ratified under the aegis of the OAU. Currently there are 61 treaties under the auspices of the African Union, and 30 of these treaties have entered into force. Note that the above information may not be correct as not all OAU/AU Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and Charters are listed in the AU website.[402] About 33 per cent of these treaties were adopted under the auspices of OAU, the predecessor of the AU. The treaties adopted under the OAU are assumed by the AU and continue to be binding on those States, which have signed and ratified them. 9.

This is the case with the United Nations Charter where some countries have withdrawn notwithstanding that it is not mentioned textually. Libya’s proposal is that this right should not be mentioned in the Act, as if states are being invited to withdraw or denounce the Act’. In the text of the same document of the proposed amendment under Article 31, Libya went further than its explanatory notes and stated that Article 31 should be deleted because ‘a state whose policy-making bodies have ratified the Constitutive Act has no grounds to withdraw from the Union, renounce its membership and request that the Act should cease to apply to it.’ [32] Constitutive Act (n 17) preamble paragraph 1 provides that member States are ‘inspired by the noble ideals which guided the founding fathers of our Continental Organisation OAU and generations of Pan-Africanists in their determination to promote unity, solidarity, cohesion and cooperation among the peoples of Africa and African States’.

See for instance Report of the Secretary-General, ‘An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping’ (1992) UN Doc A/47/277-S/24111 paragraph 61: ‘The Charter deliberately provides no precise definition of regional arrangements and agencies, thus allowing useful flexibility for undertakings by a group of States to deal with a matter appropriate for regional action which also could contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.’ [395] Schweitzer, Passau Michael and Hummer, Innsbruck Waldemar. ‘Article 52’ in Simma, Bruno and others (eds), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary. Vol. 1. Oxford University Press, 2002: 823 add: ‘Even if the distinction between the concepts of arrangements and agencies can be drawn in theory, it has little practical significance: the requirements for their admissibility and the object of their activities as well as resulting legal consequences are identical.’ [396] See art 1 and 2 of the UN Charter for the purposes and principles of the UN.

OAU </a></b></p><p>The Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union, was established by the then independent states of Africa on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> The OAU Charter served as a roadmap for the efforts and actions of the independent African States to liberate the continent from colonialism and apartheid. By the end of the 1970s, much of Africa was liberated from colonialism with the exception of the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe. This new reality in Africa led to the call for the review of the OAU Charter as early as 1979. The sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held in Monrovia, Liberia, in July 1979 established the OAU Charter Review Committee (the Committee) in a bid “to re-examine the provisions of the Charter in light of the changes and realities in Africa.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> The Committee was meant to make a detailed study of the OAU Charter in light of the current needs of the continent and come up with specific proposals for new norms and institutions that would have been instrumental in responding to the atrocities like the Rwandan genocide.</p><p>The Committee attempted to forward a proposal for new rules and institutions that would make the Charter more effective.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> Nevertheless, the activities of the Committee were very slow and highly marginalised because of the absence of active involvement of member States. New developments on the continent and worldwide, such as the total liberation of African States from colonialism, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the challenges of massive human rights violations inside independent African States and intra-state and inter-state conflicts and the end of the cold war made the transformation of the OAU a necessity.</p><h3><a name="_Toc186141735">1.2. </a><a name="SirteDeclaration">The Sirte Declaration and the Establishment of the African </a>Union</h3><p>By July 1999, when the OAU Thirty-Fifth Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Algiers, it was clear that the OAU Charter Review Committee had failed to achieve its purpose. The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government accepted a call for an extraordinary meeting on the issue of the transformation of the OAU<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> and decided to hold its 4th extraordinary meeting ‘to discuss ways and means of making the OAU effective so as to keep pace with political and economic developments taking place in the world and the preparation required of Africa within the context of globalization so as to preserve its socio-economic and political potentials.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Accordingly, the fourth extraordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Sirte, Libya on 8-9 September 1999 and adopted the Sirte Declaration, which <i>inter alia</i> called for the establishment of the African Union:</p><p>Article 8: “Having discussed frankly and extensively on how to proceed with the strengthening of the unity of our continent and its peoples, in the light of those proposals, and bearing in mind the current situation on the Continent, we decide to: (i) Establish an African Union, in conformity with the ultimate objectives of the Charter of our Continental Organization and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a></p><p>The Sirte Declaration did not specify the details of the new organisation. Rather the Declaration instructed the Council of Ministers and the Secretary-General of the OAU to work on the details of the establishment of the new organisation (African Union) and report their work to the next ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> Accordingly, the OAU Secretary-General established a Departmental Task Force under the Chairmanship of the OAU Assistant-Secretary General for Political Affairs to design the steps that should be taken by the OAU Secretariat to implement the Sirte Declaration.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> The Departmental Task force recommended involvement of expert consultants to develop the preparatory documents for the Constitutive Act of the African Union in collaboration with the OAU Secretariat.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a></p><p>In February 2000, a group of consultants with backgrounds in law, economics and politics met in Addis Ababa and came up with a draft Constitutive Act of the African Union.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> After consultation by the OAU Secretariat with member states, the draft Constitutive Act together with earlier draft proposals from member states were presented to two consecutive meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians on the establishment of the African Union that were held on 17-20 April 2000 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and 27-29 May 2000 in Tripoli, Libya respectively.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> The meetings of Experts and Parliamentarians reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and presented their assessment to a Ministerial Conference on the Establishment of the African Union on 31 May - 2 June 2000 in Tripoli, Libya. The Ministerial Conference reviewed the draft Constitutive Act and decided to establish a working group to further elaborate on the draft Constitutive Act.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> The working group submitted the revised draft Constitutive Act to the Seventy-second ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers on 6-8 July 2000 in Lomé, Togo.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a></p><p>After further deliberations, the OAU Council of Ministers approved the draft Constitutive Act and recommended its submission to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government for adoption.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> The thirty-sixth ordinary session of the OAU Assembly of the Heads of State and Government held in Lomé, Togo on 10-12 July 2000 adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union and urged member states of the OAU to ratify the Constitutive Act as soon as possible.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> The fifth extraordinary meeting of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government declared the political birth of the African Union and noted that the Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) would enter in to force 30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification by two-thirds of the member States of the OAU, as provided for in Article 28 of the Constitutive Act.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> The Constitutive Act entered into force on 26 May 2001 upon ratification by two thirds of member States of the OAU replacing the OAU Charter.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> The African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held its inaugural session in Durban, South Africa, on 9 July 2002.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></p><p><b>2. <a name="Membership">Membership of the African Union </a></b></p><p>There are three requirements for membership in the African Union (AU). First, a State should be an African State.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> Second, a simple majority of member states supports the application for membership,<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> and third, the African State should sign and ratify the AU Constitutive Act.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> “After withdrawing in 1984 from the OAU, the predecessor of the AU, Morocco re-joined the AU as its 55th member on 20 January 2017.”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> Several countries have at various times been suspended from membership of the AU. Suspension is the AU’s usual response to any interruption of constitutional rule by a member.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> The Assembly also recognises representatives of the African Diaspora,<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> and passed a Resolution inviting its representatives as observers to Assembly sessions.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> Haiti was granted Observer Status on 2 February 2012 and its request to become an associate member was denied on 17 May 2016. The AU emphasized that according to its statutes only African states can join the African Union.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a></p><p>There are no criteria set in the Constitutive Act as standards for the vote on the request for accession. Moreover, all AU member States have the same rights and obligations. The Constitutive Act does not provide for a veto power or any kind of special status for any member State of the AU.</p><p>Withdrawal of membership is allowed after a member State notifies in writing its intention to renounce its membership of the Union to the Chairperson of the AU Commission, who will communicate such notification to the other State parties of the Constitutive Act.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> The applicant should wait one year from the date of notification of its intention to renounce membership before its rights and obligations under the Constitutive Act are terminated.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> The rights and obligations of the Member State remain intact during the one year window period.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> After a window period of one year, the applicant is deemed to have withdrawn its membership if it does not rescind its decision to renounce its membership. Article 12 of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act provides for the repeal of the right to renounce membership.<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a> The explanatory notes accompanying the proposal for the removal of the right recognizes that renunciation of membership is the right of member States but nevertheless argues for the deletion of the right as it has a negative connotation on the unity of the region.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a></p><p><a name="_Toc186141792"></a></p><p><b>3. <a name="ObjectivesandPrinciples">The Objectives and Principles of the African Union</a> </b></p><p>Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitutive Act of the AU enumerate the objectives and principles of the regional organization. The objectives and principles can be summarized into the following six interrelated areas. The first three sub-sections focus on the objectives while the last three focus on explaining the principles that are meant to be used to achieve the objectives.</p><h3><a name="_Toc186141793">3.1. </a><a name="RegionalIntegration">Regional Integration</a></h3><p>The AU is planned to be a forum for the promotion of regional integration and African unity through socio-economic integration, continental research on all fields including science and technology and the development of common positions on issues of common interest.<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a> The AU also establishes institutions that nurture solidarity among African peoples, coordinate its actions with sub-regional economic communities and forges a common front in international negotiations and cooperation.<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a></p><h3><a name="_Toc186141794">3.2. </a><a name="PeaceandSecurity">Peace and Security</a></h3><p>The AU member States recognize that ‘the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent.’<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a> Thus, one important objective area of the AU is the establishment of collective security system in a bid to promote peace and security as a prerequisite for development on the continent.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[35]</a> The focus on peace and security can also be gathered from the new norms and institutions of collective security that member States established.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[36]</a> AU member States pledge to strengthen and provide necessary mandate and resources to all relevant institutions including institutions for the maintenance of collective security.<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a></p><h3><a name="_Toc186141795">3.3. </a><a name="HumanRights">Protection of Human Rights</a></h3><p>The protection of human rights is provided as one major objective for the establishment of the AU. One reason given by member States for establishing the AU is their determination ‘to promote and protect human and peoples’ rights, consolidate democratic institutions and culture, and to ensure good governance and the rule of law.’<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38]</a> Thus, the AU member States set the observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as one objective of the organization.<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[39]</a> Moreover, the promotion of ‘democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance’ is provided as an objective of the organization within the promotion and protection of the rights of African people. <a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="">[40]</a></p><h3><a name="_Toc186141796">3.4. </a><a name="NonIntervention">Non-Intervention</a></h3><p>The AU Constitutive Act rules out unilateral intervention between member States. Unilateral intervention among member States is pointed out as a common security threat on the continent.<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[41]</a> Apart from the direct principle of ‘non-interference by any Member State in the internal affairs of another,’<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="">[42]</a> the non-intervention norm is expressed through many principles of the organisation. For instance, the Constitutive Act rejects subversive activities in member States.<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43]</a> Subversion is defined as constituting ‘any act that incites, aggravates or creates dissension within or among Member States with the intention or purpose to destabilize or overthrow the existing regime or political order by, among other means, fomenting racial, religious, linguistic, ethnic and other differences’ in violation of the Constitutive Act and the Charter of the United Nations.<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[44]</a> Thus, subversion does not only include the use or threat of military force, which is prohibited under the Constitutive Act,<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45]</a> but also the non-military means of interference.<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[46]</a> The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the AU proposes two additional principles on subversion that request ‘restraint by any Member State from entering into any treaty or alliance that is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the Union’ and prohibit ‘any Member State from allowing the use of its territory as a base for subversion against another Member State.’<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title="">[47]</a></p><p>The AU non-intervention principle is based on the principles of sovereign equality and interdependence among member States and respect of borders existing on achievement of independence.<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="">[48]</a> The principles of ‘peaceful co-existence of Member States and their right to live in peace and security’ and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among member States are also the basis of the non-intervention norm among member States of the AU. <a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="">[49]</a></p><h3><a name="_Toc186141797">3.5. </a><a name="Intervention">Intervention</a></h3><p>Intervention in member States under the AU constitutes an unprecedented principle under international law. The AU is endowed with the right to intervene ‘in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.’<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="">[50]</a> The Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union adds ‘a serious threat to legitimate order to restore peace and stability to the Member State of the Union’ as an additional element that would trigger intervention by the AU in a member State as well as crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title="">[51]</a></p><p>AU member States have also agreed on the right to ‘request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and security.’<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title="">[52]</a> This is a case of intervention by invitation. The request for intervention from a member State is made to the Assembly of the AU, which is the highest decision-making organ.<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title="">[53]</a></p><h3>3.6. <a name="RespectforDemocracy">Respect for Democracy and Rule of Law </a></h3><p>AU member States have acknowledged the relation between democracy, rule of law and economic development. The principles of respect for democracy, rule of law, and good governance are adopted as precondition for social justice that ensures economic development in member States of the AU.<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title="">[54]</a> The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (a.k.a NEPAD) is one framework launched by African States that links the respect for civil and political rights with the right to development in member States of the AU.<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="">[55]</a> AU member States adopted the principle of ‘condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of governments.’<a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title="">[56]</a> The rejection of impunity is also a principle adopted by the AU member States that strengthen their commitment to the rule of law.<a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="">[57]</a></p><h2><a name="_Toc186141799">4. </a><a name="InstitutionsofAfricanUnion">The Institutions of the African Union</a></h2><p>Article 5 of the AU Constitutive Act provides for the establishment of the following institutions of the Union: the Assembly, the Executive Council, the Specialized Technical Committees, the Pan-African Parliament, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights,<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title="">[58]</a> the Financial Institutions, the Commission, the Permanent Representatives Committee, and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council.<a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title="">[59]</a> Another key institution, which was not directly established by the Constitutive Act, is the AU Peace and Security Council.
