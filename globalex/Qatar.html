Its territory comprises of a number of islands including Halul, Sheraouh, Al-Ashat and others. It has maritime and land borders with Saudi Arabia and maritime boundaries with Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Iran. The total land area of Qatar is approximately about 11,500 square kilometers. The terrain is flat and rocky with some low-rising limestone outcrops in Dukhan area in the west and Jabal Fiwairit in the north. It is characterized by a variety of geographical phenomena including many coves, inlets, depressions and surface rainwater-draining basins known as riyadh (the gardens), which are found mainly in the north and central part of the peninsula. These areas have the most fertile soil and are rich in vegetation. Islam is the official religion of the country and Arabic is the official language in Qatar, and English is widely spoken. The major towns are Doha, Al Wakrah, Al Khor, Dukhan, Al Shamal, Mesaieed, Ras Lafan and others. Doha is the capital city, the seat of government and the location of the main commercial and financial institutions. Situated halfway along the East Coast of the peninsula, the city is an important cultural and commercial center with a vast commercial seaport and a modern international airport that link the country to the rest of the world. More than half of the population lives in Doha. In accordance with the provisions of the second Article of the Constitution the capital of the state is Doha City; and it may be transferred to any other place by a law. The population of Qatar amounts to 743,000 inhabitants (according to the initial results of the second stage of the 2004 population census) compared to 522,000 inhabitants in the last census conducted in 1997. 83% of the inhabitants reside in Doha and its main suburb Al-Rayyan. History of Qatar   The Ancient History The land of Qatar was populated as early as 4000 BC. The archeological discoveries which were found in scattered areas in the country have proven that. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus referred to the seafaring Canaanites as the original inhabitants of Qatar. Further, the geographer Ptolemy showed in his map of the Arab World &quot;Qatara&quot; as believed to refer to the Qatari town of &quot;Zubara&quot;, which has acquired the fame of being one of the most important trading ports in the Gulf region at the time. Qatar played an important role in the Islamic civilization when its inhabitants participated in the formation and provision of the first naval fleet, which was assembled to transport the army during the Islamic conquests. Under the Abbasid State during the 8th century AH (the 14th century AD), Qatar experienced great economic prosperity as can be gleaned from the inscriptions on the Murwab Fort on the western coast of the peninsula, which bears the marks of the Abbasid architectural style. During the 16th century AD, the Qataris aligned with the Turks to drive out the Portuguese. Subsequently, Qatar alongside the whole regions of the Arabian Peninsula came under the Ottoman Empire rule for about four successive centuries. In the aftermath of the 1914 First World War, the Turkish rule in Qatar came to an end and Qatar signed a protection treaty with Britain in 1916. However, the British influence in the country was limited to supervision of some administrative matters. The Modern History and Independence: The State of Qatar became an independent country on the 3rd of September 1971, by treaty of friendship between the state of Qatar and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The rule of the State of Qatar is hereditary in the family of Al Thani, who settled in Qatar peninsula early in the 18th century. Qatar was ruled by the Al-Thani family, who take their name from their ancestor, Thani, father of Skeikh Mohammad Bin Thani, who was the first Sheikh to rule over the Qatari peninsula during the mid 19th century. The Al-Thani family was one among many tribal groups that settled for a long time at the &quot;Gibrin&quot; oasis in the southern Najd, before their arrival at Qatar during the early 18th century. It is a branch of the Bani Tamim tribe, whose descent can be traced back to Mudar Bin Nizar. Initially they settled in Zubara in the north of the peninsula, moving to Doha in the mid 19th century under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammad Bin Thani. Timeline In 1878 Sheikh Jassim Bin Mohammad succeeded his father Sheikh Mohammad bin Thani. ·      In 1913 Sheikh Abdallah bin Jassim came to power. It was in his time when oil was first discovered in Qatar. ·      In 1940 Sheikh Hamad Bin Abdullah ruled Qatar until 1948. ·      In 1949 Sheikh Ali bin Abdallah came to power and ruled until 1960. And in that year, Sheikh Ahmad Bin Ali ruled Qatar and his reign continued until 1972. ·      In 1972, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani ruled the country. On September 3rd, 1971 Qatar became independent. ·      In 1995 Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani assumed power with the support and blessings of the ruling family and the Qatari people. In 1999 the election of the municipal council was the first electoral process taking place in Qatar in modern history.  According to the Law (12) for the year of 1998 it took place the organization of the Central Municipal Council.

Its territory comprises of a number of islands including Halul, Sheraouh, Al-Ashat and others. It has maritime and land borders with Saudi Arabia and maritime boundaries with Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Iran. The total land area of Qatar is approximately about 11,500 square kilometers. The terrain is flat and rocky with some low-rising limestone outcrops in Dukhan area in the west and Jabal Fiwairit in the north. It is characterized by a variety of geographical phenomena including many coves, inlets, depressions and surface rainwater-draining basins known as riyadh (the gardens), which are found mainly in the north and central part of the peninsula. These areas have the most fertile soil and are rich in vegetation. Islam is the official religion of the country and Arabic is the official language in Qatar, and English is widely spoken. The major towns are Doha, Al Wakrah, Al Khor, Dukhan, Al Shamal, Mesaieed, Ras Lafan and others. Doha is the capital city, the seat of government and the location of the main commercial and financial institutions. Situated halfway along the East Coast of the peninsula, the city is an important cultural and commercial center with a vast commercial seaport and a modern international airport that link the country to the rest of the world. More than half of the population lives in Doha. In accordance with the provisions of the second Article of the Constitution the capital of the state is Doha City; and it may be transferred to any other place by a law. The population of Qatar amounts to 743,000 inhabitants (according to the initial results of the second stage of the 2004 population census) compared to 522,000 inhabitants in the last census conducted in 1997. 83% of the inhabitants reside in Doha and its main suburb Al-Rayyan. History of Qatar   The Ancient History The land of Qatar was populated as early as 4000 BC. The archeological discoveries which were found in scattered areas in the country have proven that. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus referred to the seafaring Canaanites as the original inhabitants of Qatar. Further, the geographer Ptolemy showed in his map of the Arab World &quot;Qatara&quot; as believed to refer to the Qatari town of &quot;Zubara&quot;, which has acquired the fame of being one of the most important trading ports in the Gulf region at the time. Qatar played an important role in the Islamic civilization when its inhabitants participated in the formation and provision of the first naval fleet, which was assembled to transport the army during the Islamic conquests. Under the Abbasid State during the 8th century AH (the 14th century AD), Qatar experienced great economic prosperity as can be gleaned from the inscriptions on the Murwab Fort on the western coast of the peninsula, which bears the marks of the Abbasid architectural style. During the 16th century AD, the Qataris aligned with the Turks to drive out the Portuguese. Subsequently, Qatar alongside the whole regions of the Arabian Peninsula came under the Ottoman Empire rule for about four successive centuries. In the aftermath of the 1914 First World War, the Turkish rule in Qatar came to an end and Qatar signed a protection treaty with Britain in 1916. However, the British influence in the country was limited to supervision of some administrative matters. The Modern History and Independence: The State of Qatar became an independent country on the 3rd of September 1971, by treaty of friendship between the state of Qatar and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The rule of the State of Qatar is hereditary in the family of Al Thani, who settled in Qatar peninsula early in the 18th century. Qatar was ruled by the Al-Thani family, who take their name from their ancestor, Thani, father of Skeikh Mohammad Bin Thani, who was the first Sheikh to rule over the Qatari peninsula during the mid 19th century. The Al-Thani family was one among many tribal groups that settled for a long time at the &quot;Gibrin&quot; oasis in the southern Najd, before their arrival at Qatar during the early 18th century. It is a branch of the Bani Tamim tribe, whose descent can be traced back to Mudar Bin Nizar. Initially they settled in Zubara in the north of the peninsula, moving to Doha in the mid 19th century under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammad Bin Thani. Timeline In 1878 Sheikh Jassim Bin Mohammad succeeded his father Sheikh Mohammad bin Thani. ·      In 1913 Sheikh Abdallah bin Jassim came to power. It was in his time when oil was first discovered in Qatar. ·      In 1940 Sheikh Hamad Bin Abdullah ruled Qatar until 1948. ·      In 1949 Sheikh Ali bin Abdallah came to power and ruled until 1960. And in that year, Sheikh Ahmad Bin Ali ruled Qatar and his reign continued until 1972. ·      In 1972, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani ruled the country. On September 3rd, 1971 Qatar became independent. ·      In 1995 Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani assumed power with the support and blessings of the ruling family and the Qatari people. In 1999 the election of the municipal council was the first electoral process taking place in Qatar in modern history.  According to the Law (12) for the year of 1998 it took place the organization of the Central Municipal Council. The Qatar Legal System Shari’a (Islamic law) is the main source of legislations. The first Article of permanent Constitution of the state of Qatar states that “Qatar is an independent sovereign Arab State and the people of Qatar are a part of the Arab nation. Its religion is Islam and Shari’a law (Islamic Religious Law) is main source of its legislations. Its political system is democratic. The Arabic  language  shall be  its official language”. The Basic System   Issuance and Amendment of the Constitution On 19th April, 1971, the drafting committee of the Permanent Constitution issued the Constitution Provisional Amended Basic Statute that defined the system of rule in the State, organized its authorities and established the fundamental principles of its policy. But, thirty years have elapsed since the statute was issued in 1971. The H.H. Amir decree (No.11) of the year 1999 was issued for the preparation committee of the new Constitution. The H.H. Amir was keen that the committee members were men of intellect, opinion and expertise. The H.H. Amir was directed towards concluding the establishment of a modern state, by enhancing the role of Shari’a, democracy and the popular participation of the citizen in decision making. Referendum on the Constitution: After a 3 year period was set for the preparation of the Constitution, the voters agreed to the new Constitution of the country on Tuesday 29th April 2004 by expressing their opinions in the ballot boxes. The new Constitution underlined the main outlines of the Constitution which would be a sign post to the building and definition of the system of the rule and determining the State’s authorities and their specialization, and their relations to each other and the citizens. Amendment of Constitution: By Article 144 of Permanent Constitution, the Amir or one third of the Members of Al-Shoura Council each shall have the prerogative to apply for the amendment of one or more of the articles of this Constitution. If the majority of the Members of the Council accept the amendment in principle, the Council may discuss it article by article. The amendment shall be passed by a two-thirds majority of the Members of the Council. The said amendment shall not be into force before the approval of the Amir and its publication in the official Gazette. If, on the other hand, the proposal for amendment is rejected in principle or in subject, it may not be re-introduced before the lapse of one year from the date of its rejection. The Articles (145:149) of Permanent Constitution add that the provisions pertaining to the rule of the state and its inheritance thereof may not be subject to application for amendment. And Provisions pertaining to rights and public liberties may not be subject to amendment save for the purpose of granting more rights and guarantees in the interest of the citizen. Furthermore, the functions of the Amir set forth in this Constitution may not be subject to an application for amendment during the term of his deputation. The Article 148 of the Constitution makes clear that no article of this Constitution may be proposed for amendment before the lapse of a period of ten years from the date of its coming into force. And Article 149 adds that no provision of this Constitution may be suspended save where martial laws are in force and within the limits specified by the law; however, the convening of the session of Al-Shoura Council may not be suspended nor should the immunity of its Members be violated during this period. The Values of Justice and of Issuance of Laws The Article 35 of the Constitution clearly states that all persons are equal before the law and there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex, race, language, or religion. The Constitution confirms the established  principles of law , for example , the  Article 35  clearly states that all persons are equal before the law and there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex, race, language, or religion . And Article 39 points out that an accused person is presumed innocent until his conviction is proved before a court of law wherein the necessary guarantees of the right of self-defense are secured. Article 40 adds that no crime and no punishment save as prescribed by the law and no penalties save on the acts committed subsequent to the enforcement of that law.  The provisions of the laws shall have no effect save on the acts committed from the date of the enforcement of the said laws. These provisions shall have no effect on the acts which occurred prior to the enforcement of the said laws; however, it may be stipulated otherwise by a majority of two-thirds of Al-Shoura Council in case of non-criminal provisions. Issuance of Laws The first Article of permanent constitution of the state of Qatar points out that Shari’a law (Islamic Religious Law) shall be a main source of its legislations. Its political system is democratic. Articles 105&amp;106 of permanent constitution clearly state that the laws issued through every Member of the Council shall have the right to propose bills. Every proposal shall be referred to the relevant committee in the Council for study, making recommendation and submission to the Council.

Its territory comprises of a number of islands including Halul, Sheraouh, Al-Ashat and others. It has maritime and land borders with Saudi Arabia and maritime boundaries with Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Iran. The total land area of Qatar is approximately about 11,500 square kilometers. The terrain is flat and rocky with some low-rising limestone outcrops in Dukhan area in the west and Jabal Fiwairit in the north. It is characterized by a variety of geographical phenomena including many coves, inlets, depressions and surface rainwater-draining basins known as riyadh (the gardens), which are found mainly in the north and central part of the peninsula. These areas have the most fertile soil and are rich in vegetation. Islam is the official religion of the country and Arabic is the official language in Qatar, and English is widely spoken. The major towns are Doha, Al Wakrah, Al Khor, Dukhan, Al Shamal, Mesaieed, Ras Lafan and others. Doha is the capital city, the seat of government and the location of the main commercial and financial institutions. Situated halfway along the East Coast of the peninsula, the city is an important cultural and commercial center with a vast commercial seaport and a modern international airport that link the country to the rest of the world. More than half of the population lives in Doha. In accordance with the provisions of the second Article of the Constitution the capital of the state is Doha City; and it may be transferred to any other place by a law. The population of Qatar amounts to 743,000 inhabitants (according to the initial results of the second stage of the 2004 population census) compared to 522,000 inhabitants in the last census conducted in 1997. 83% of the inhabitants reside in Doha and its main suburb Al-Rayyan. History of Qatar   The Ancient History The land of Qatar was populated as early as 4000 BC. The archeological discoveries which were found in scattered areas in the country have proven that. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus referred to the seafaring Canaanites as the original inhabitants of Qatar. Further, the geographer Ptolemy showed in his map of the Arab World &quot;Qatara&quot; as believed to refer to the Qatari town of &quot;Zubara&quot;, which has acquired the fame of being one of the most important trading ports in the Gulf region at the time. Qatar played an important role in the Islamic civilization when its inhabitants participated in the formation and provision of the first naval fleet, which was assembled to transport the army during the Islamic conquests. Under the Abbasid State during the 8th century AH (the 14th century AD), Qatar experienced great economic prosperity as can be gleaned from the inscriptions on the Murwab Fort on the western coast of the peninsula, which bears the marks of the Abbasid architectural style. During the 16th century AD, the Qataris aligned with the Turks to drive out the Portuguese. Subsequently, Qatar alongside the whole regions of the Arabian Peninsula came under the Ottoman Empire rule for about four successive centuries. In the aftermath of the 1914 First World War, the Turkish rule in Qatar came to an end and Qatar signed a protection treaty with Britain in 1916. However, the British influence in the country was limited to supervision of some administrative matters. The Modern History and Independence: The State of Qatar became an independent country on the 3rd of September 1971, by treaty of friendship between the state of Qatar and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The rule of the State of Qatar is hereditary in the family of Al Thani, who settled in Qatar peninsula early in the 18th century. Qatar was ruled by the Al-Thani family, who take their name from their ancestor, Thani, father of Skeikh Mohammad Bin Thani, who was the first Sheikh to rule over the Qatari peninsula during the mid 19th century. The Al-Thani family was one among many tribal groups that settled for a long time at the &quot;Gibrin&quot; oasis in the southern Najd, before their arrival at Qatar during the early 18th century. It is a branch of the Bani Tamim tribe, whose descent can be traced back to Mudar Bin Nizar. Initially they settled in Zubara in the north of the peninsula, moving to Doha in the mid 19th century under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammad Bin Thani. Timeline In 1878 Sheikh Jassim Bin Mohammad succeeded his father Sheikh Mohammad bin Thani. ·      In 1913 Sheikh Abdallah bin Jassim came to power. It was in his time when oil was first discovered in Qatar. ·      In 1940 Sheikh Hamad Bin Abdullah ruled Qatar until 1948. ·      In 1949 Sheikh Ali bin Abdallah came to power and ruled until 1960. And in that year, Sheikh Ahmad Bin Ali ruled Qatar and his reign continued until 1972. ·      In 1972, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani ruled the country. On September 3rd, 1971 Qatar became independent. ·      In 1995 Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani assumed power with the support and blessings of the ruling family and the Qatari people. In 1999 the election of the municipal council was the first electoral process taking place in Qatar in modern history.  According to the Law (12) for the year of 1998 it took place the organization of the Central Municipal Council. The Qatar Legal System Shari’a (Islamic law) is the main source of legislations. The first Article of permanent Constitution of the state of Qatar states that “Qatar is an independent sovereign Arab State and the people of Qatar are a part of the Arab nation. Its religion is Islam and Shari’a law (Islamic Religious Law) is main source of its legislations. Its political system is democratic. The Arabic  language  shall be  its official language”. The Basic System   Issuance and Amendment of the Constitution On 19th April, 1971, the drafting committee of the Permanent Constitution issued the Constitution Provisional Amended Basic Statute that defined the system of rule in the State, organized its authorities and established the fundamental principles of its policy. But, thirty years have elapsed since the statute was issued in 1971. The H.H. Amir decree (No.11) of the year 1999 was issued for the preparation committee of the new Constitution. The H.H.
