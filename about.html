                  <h1>About</h1>

                  <p>GlobaLex is an open access electronic legal publication dedicated to international, comparative, and foreign law research. It is committed to the publication and dissemination of high-level international, comparative, and foreign law research articles to accommodate the needs of an increasingly global educational and practicing legal world.</p>

                  <p>The articles published by GlobaLex are used and relied on as research and teaching resources by legal academics, practitioners and other specialists around the world who are either active in international, comparative, and foreign law research or focus on their own domestic law. Scholars who are well known in their respective fields and are recommended as legal resources by universities, law schools, library schools, and legal training institutions author articles on GlobaLex. Our global network of authors includes law librarians, professors, judges, lawyers, Ph.D. candidates, and many other legal information professionals who represent a majority of the world’s jurisdictions. Since its inception, GlobaLex has continued to expand to cover a variety of international law topics in response to new developments, foreign jurisdictions and legal systems not previously included, and has featured comparative articles surveying jurisdictions on a particular topic. GlobaLex continues to be a coherent and encompassing research tool for all constituencies.</p>

                  <p>Founded in 2005 by Mirela Roznovschi with the visionary support of Prof. Joseph Weiler, GlobaLex is published by the Hauser Global Law School Program at NYU School of Law. Ms. Roznovschi, the founding editor, built and led this publication for more than a decade until 2015 when she retired. In 2007, GlobaLex received the Website Award from the International Association of Law Libraries (IALL). In 2015, Mirela Roznovschi received the <a href="https://www.aallnet.org/fcilsis/awards-grants/reynolds-flores-publication-award/">2015 Reynold and Flores Publication Award</a> from the Foreign, Comparative, and International Law Special Interest Section (FCIL-SIS) of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) for her work on GlobaLex. Lucie Olejnikova became the Editor in 2015 when Ms. Roznovschi retired, and has been managing and overseeing the editorial, publication, and overall process of GlobaLex since. GlobaLex continues to be possible also because of the unwavering and generous support of the Hauser Global Law School Program of the NYU School of Law.</p>

                  <p>Over the years, GlobaLex has grown into one of the must-know, must-have-access-to publications. Its reach is global, and so is its audience and authorship. Because GlobaLex articles are consistently updated, many have grown into comprehensive chapters on a particular topic or jurisdiction. GlobaLex proudly contributes to the global open access movement by ensuring equal access to its content. GlobaLex articles are regularly cited by array of publications, including treatises on international law research, law review and journal articles on international and foreign law, as well as cases from the United States courts. GlobaLex is referenced on countless webpages dedicated to legal information and law research. We encourage you to explore GlobaLex!</p>
